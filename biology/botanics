growth
- slower growing trees have denser wood and are more resistant to storms and pests

plant defense
- production of toxins (Alkaloids, Tannins)
- release of VOC to attract insect predators
- Pyrophyte: resistant to fire (Pinus, Sequoia, Eucalyptus)

plant communication
- electrical signal, spreads ~1cm/s (slow)
- release of VOC (volatile organic compound), similar to pheromones
- release of ethylene as warning signal
- Mycorrhizal network: funghi connecting root systems (wood wide web)

reproduction
- colorful flowers and scents to attract pollinators
- Mast year: large quantity of seeding (oak, beech)
- some seeds can remain dormant for many years
- Pyrophile: seed germinate after forest fire (Pinus)

Drunken trees: trees variously tilted due to melting permafrost
Fog drip: water adhering to leaves and dropping to ground
Blackwater river: dark color and lower pH caused by leaching of soluble tannins from plants
