growth
- slower growing trees have denser wood and are more resistant to storms and pests

plant defense
- production of toxins (Alkaloids, Tannins)
- release of VOC to attract insect predators
- Pyrophyte: resistant to fire (Pinus, Sequoia, Eucalyptus)

plant communication
- electrical signal, spreads ~1cm/s (slow)
- release of VOC (volatile organic compound), similar to pheromones
- release of ethylene as warning signal
- Mycorrhizal network: funghi connecting root systems (wood wide web)

#Phytochemicals
Phytoncide: antimicrobial VOC, more in conifers

reproduction
- colorful flowers and scents to attract pollinators
- Mast year: large quantity of seeding (oak, beech)
- some seeds can remain dormant for many years
- Pyrophile: seed germinate after forest fire (Pinus)

Drunken trees: trees variously tilted due to melting permafrost
Fog drip: water adhering to leaves and dropping to ground
Blackwater river: dark color and lower pH caused by leaching of soluble tannins from plants

Radiosynthesis: energy from ionizing radiation, melanin pigment, fungi
Photosynthesis: energy from sunlight
- Oxygenic photosynthesis: produces oxygen
- Anoxygenic photosynthesis: produces sulfur
- Calvin cycle: converts CO2 and hydrogen carrier into glucose

=plant senescence: aging
winter
- carbohydrates stored in twigs and roots
- Chlorophyll degradation: nitrogen and magnesium stored in twigs and roots
- Autumn leaf color: other pigments visible after chlorophyll degradation

=Wood-decay fungus: digest moist wood, cause rot, enter tree via bark wounds or excess moisture
can cause tree hollow when heartwood is attacked
Soft rot: break down cellulose by cellulase, slow
Brown rot: break down cellulose by H2O2, brittle wood
White rot: break down cellulose and lignin, spongy wood
