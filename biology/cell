Apoptosis: programmed cell death

#Cell: basic unit of life
usually has negative charge

#Prokaryotic cell: bacteria, archaea
diameter around 1μm
lacks nucleus, DNA in single circular chromosome
only ribosomes, lacks membrane-bound organelles
enveloped by membrane and wall
movement by flagella
pilus: hairlike appendage, transfer of DNA in conjugation
fimbria: short hairlike appendage, attachment to surface
capsule: prevents phagocytosis, protects against desiccation, composed of polysaccharides
slime layer: adhesion to smooth surfaces, protection, loosely attached
bacteria
- additionally can be enveloped by capsule or slime layer
- gram-negative bacteria have also outer membrane

#Eukaryotic cell: fungi, plantae, animalia
diameter around 10μm
nucleus with double membrane containing DNA
enveloped by membrane and wall
movement by flagella or cilia
porosome: membrane pore for secretion of vesicles
animalia
- only eveloper by membrane, lacks wall

#Cytoplasm: all material within cell
Cytosol: liquid inside cells

#Organelle: eclosed in lipid bilayer membrane
Ribosome: protein synthesis, without membrane
- free ribosome proteins get released to cytosol
- RER ribosome proteins get bound to membrane or secreted from cell
Mitochondrion: double membrane, aerobic respiration generates ATP
Endoplasmic reticulum: protein folding
- rough: covered with ribosomes
- smooth: synthesis of lipids and steroids
Golgi apparatus: packaging and processing proteins
Centriole: nine sets of microtubules, usually triplets, doublets in crabs/drosophila
Flagellum: long hairlike protuberance on outside, motility, move slow
Peroxisome: breakdown of fatty acids
Stress granule: under stress, condensate of proteins and RNA
Vacuole: in plants and fungi, process water and waste products
Vesicle: material transport
Chloroplast: in plants, photosynthesis
Glyoxysome: in plants
Centrosome: in animals, microtubule formation
Cilium: in animals, short hairlike protuberance on outside, motility, move fast
Lysosome: in animals, break down of biomolecules
Melanosome: in animals, pigment storage

#Cells: 30T in adult body
erythrocytes: 85%
placelets/thrombocytes: 5%
bone marrow: 2.5%
vascular endothelium: 2%
lymphocytes: 1.5%
hepatocytes: 1%
neurons: 0.5%
bronchial endothelium: 0.5%
epidermis: 0.5%

#Bone marrow
Megakaryocyte: large, produce thrombocytes
- lobated nucleus, replicate DNA by endomitosis
