Apoptosis: programmed cell death

#Cell: basic unit of life
usually has negative charge

#Prokaryotic cell: bacteria, archaea
diameter around 1μm
lacks nucleus, DNA in single circular chromosome
only ribosomes, lacks membrane-bound organelles
enveloped by membrane and wall
movement by flagella
pilus: hairlike appendage, transfer of DNA in conjugation
fimbria: short hairlike appendage, attachment to surface
capsule: prevents phagocytosis, protects against desiccation, composed of polysaccharides
slime layer: adhesion to smooth surfaces, protection, loosely attached
bacteria
- additionally can be enveloped by capsule or slime layer
- gram-negative bacteria have also outer membrane

#Eukaryotic cell: fungi, plantae, animalia
diameter around 10μm
nucleus with double membrane containing DNA
enveloped by membrane and wall
movement by flagella or cilia
porosome: membrane pore for secretion of vesicles
animalia
- only eveloper by membrane, lacks wall

#Cytoplasm: all material within cell
Cytosol: liquid inside cells

#Organelle: eclosed in lipid bilayer membrane
Ribosome: protein synthesis, without membrane
- free ribosome proteins get released to cytosol
- RER ribosome proteins get bound to membrane or secreted from cell
Mitochondrion: double membrane, aerobic respiration generates ATP
Endoplasmic reticulum: protein folding
- rough: covered with ribosomes
- smooth: synthesis of lipids and steroids
Golgi apparatus: packaging and processing proteins
Centriole: nine sets of microtubules, usually triplets, doublets in crabs/drosophila
Flagellum: long hairlike protuberance on outside, motility, move slow
Peroxisome: breakdown of fatty acids
Stress granule: under stress, condensate of proteins and RNA
Vacuole: in plants and fungi, process water and waste products
Vesicle: material transport
Chloroplast: in plants, photosynthesis
Glyoxysome: in plants
Centrosome: in animals, microtubule formation
Cilium: in animals, short hairlike protuberance on outside, motility, move fast
Lysosome: in animals, break down of biomolecules
Melanosome: in animals, pigment storage

#Cells: 30T in adult body
erythrocytes: 85%
platelets/thrombocytes: 5%
bone marrow: 2.5%
vascular endothelium: 2%
lymphocytes: 1.5%
hepatocytes: 1%
neurons: 0.5%
bronchial endothelium: 0.5%
epidermis: 0.5%

#Bone marrow
Megakaryocyte: large, produce thrombocytes
- lobated nucleus, replicate DNA by endomitosis

#Epithelium
Goblet cell: secrete mucin
- in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts

#Gastrointestinal tract
Microfold cell (M cell): selective endocytosis of antigens, transport to macrophages and lymphocytes

#Nervous system
=Neuron: electrically excitable, communicate in network via synapses, pass signal by neurotransmitters
- Dendrites: multiple short projections, input
- Axon: single long projection, output
- Synapse: connection between dendrite and axon of two neurons
- Rosehip neuron: in cerebral cortex, inhibitory GABAergic
Sensory: respond to stimuli from receptors
Motor: control muscles and glands
Interneurons: communication between sensory and motor neurons, central nervous system
=Glia: non-neuron cells
Oligodendrocyte: central nervous system, axon insulation as myelin sheath (multiple)
Astrocyte: central nervous system, star shaped, provide nutritients
Microglia: central nervous system, active immune defense
Ependymal call: central nervous system, produces cerebrospinal fluid
Satellite cell: peripheral nervous system, protective
Schwann cell: peripheral nervous system, support neurons
- myelinating: axon insulation as myelin sheath (single)
- nonmyelinating

#Circulatory system
Erythrocyte: red blood cell, oxygen transport
Thrombocytes/Platelet: no nucleus, stop bleeding by making blood clot

#Integumentary system
Keratinocyte: epidermis barrier
Melanocyte: UV radiation protection
Langerhans cell: resident macrophage
Merkel cell: touch sensation
=Epidermis layers
1- Stratum basale: Basal cells
2- Stratum spinosum: Spinous cells
3- Stratum granulosum: Granular cells
4- Stratum lucidum: palms and soles only
5- Stratum corneum: Corneocytes, dead tissue

Autocrine signaling
Paracrine signaling
Quorum sensing: gene regulation based on cell population density
