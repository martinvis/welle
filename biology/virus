=Virus
Spike protein: rod shaped, on surface
- interact with receptors on cell membrane
Life cycle
- Entry: makes hole in host cell membrane (spikes)
- Replication: takes control of host cell
- Shedding: leaves host cell
- Latency: hides within host cell to avoid immune system

=Varidnaviria
DNA viruses
genome size 20-200kb

#Adenoviridae

- spread through air droplets
- causes fever

#Poxviridae
Variola virus
- causes smallpox (30% death rate, eradicated by vaccines)

=Monodnaviria
single stranded DNA viruses
genome size 2-10kb

#Papillomaviridae
Human papillomavirus (HPV)
- spread through sexual contact
- can cause warts and cancer (HPV16/HPV18)

#Parvoviridae
Parvovirus B19
- spread through air droplets
- causes red rash
- usually in children

=Duplodnaviria
double stranded DNA viruses
genome size 20-200kb
icosahedral capsid

- high prevalence
- usually no symptoms
Herpes simplex virus
- very contagious
- can cause blisters
Epsteinâ€“Barr virus / Herpesvirus 4
- common, oncogenic
- no vaccine
- spread by saliva
- Mononucleosis: swollen lymph nodes, swollen spleen or liver

- causes chickenpox: skin rash

=Riboviria
RNA viruses
genome size 3-30kb

#Orthomyxoviridae
Influenza A virus
- spread through air droplets
- causes influenza: fever, cough
- classified by surface proteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N)
- H1N1 caused spanish flu
- H5N1 causes bird flu

#Flaviviridae
Dengue virus
- spread by mosquitoes
- causes fever
Yellow fever virus
- spread by mosquitoes
- can cause liver damage resulting in yellow skin
Zika virus
- spread by mosquitoes
- causes microcephaly to unborn babies
West Nile virus:
- spread by mosquitoes, primary host birds
- causes West Nile fever, usually no symptoms, no vaccine
Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV):
- spread by ticks
- causes encephalitis or meningitis

#Retroviridae
HIV
- no vaccine
- spread through sexual contact
- infects immune cells: dendritic cells, helper T cells and macrophages
- retrovirus: insert DNA copy of its RNA to host cell DNA, high mutation rate
- stages: acute (mild symptoms, high transmission), chronic (no symptoms, low transmission), AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)
- AIDS: immune system can not fight off infections
Gammaretrovirus
- causes leukemias in animals (FeLV in cats)

#Picornaviridae
Hepatovirus A
- spread by contaminated food
- causes hepatitis A: vomiting, diarrhoea, jaundice

- spread through body fluids
- causes fever and diarrhoea
- death rate ~50%

#Hepadnaviridae
Hepatovirus B
- spread through body fluids
- causes hepatitis B: jaundice, liver damage

#Paramyxoviridae
Measles morbillivirus
- spread through air droplets, very contagious
- can kill memory cells of immune system
- causes measles: fever, cough, erythematous rash
Mumps virus
- spread through air droplets
- causes mumps: fever, swelling

#Rhabdoviridae
