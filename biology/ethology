Signalling theory: communication between individuals within and across species
- Handicap principle: honest signal that is costly (peacock tail)
Evolutionary stable strategy (ESS): once fixed in population natural selection prevents it being replaced by alternatives
Sexual selection: evolutionary pressure within species
- males: frequent mating, monopolizing access to females
- females: selecting best males
- sexual dimorphism: ornate plumage, antlers
- Fisherian runaway: positive feedback loop in trait preference (peacock)
- Fisher's principle: equilibrium ratio 1:1 of males:females because it is ESS

Aposematism: advertising danger to predators (poison frogs)
Camouflage: making hard to see (chameleon, octopus)
Deimatism: distracting predator (butterfly eyespots)

#Mimicry: evolved resemblance to another object / organism
Aggressive: predator avoids identification (anglerfish)
Batesian: harmless mimics harmful (hoverflies)
MÃ¼llerian: shares honest warning signal (predator learns faster)
Mertensian/Emsleyan: deadly prey mimics less-deadly (predator can survive and learn)
Vavilovian: weed resembles crop
