Signalling theory: communication between individuals within and across species
- Handicap principle: honest signal that is costly (peacock tail)
Evolutionary stable strategy (ESS): once fixed in population natural selection prevents it being replaced by alternatives
Sexual selection: evolutionary pressure within species
- males: frequent mating, monopolizing access to females
- females: selecting best males
- sexual dimorphism: ornate plumage, antlers
- Fisherian runaway: positive feedback loop in trait preference (peacock)
- Fisher's principle: equilibrium ratio 1:1 of males:females because it is ESS

Aposematism: advertising danger to predators (poison frogs)
Camouflage: making hard to see (chameleon, octopus)
Deimatism: distracting predator (butterfly eyespots)

#Mimicry: evolved resemblance to another object / organism
Aggressive: predator avoids identification (anglerfish)
Batesian: harmless mimics harmful (hoverflies)
MÃ¼llerian: shares honest warning signal (predator learns faster)
Mertensian/Emsleyan: deadly prey mimics less-deadly (predator can survive and learn)
Vavilovian: weed resembles crop

Thermoregulation
- larger animals maintain temperature easier, surface-area vs volume
- Bergmann's rule: species within clade are larger in colder environment
- Allen's rule: animals in colder environment have shorter thicker limbs
- homeotherm: stable internal body temperature
- poikotherm: variable internal body temperature
- endotherm: body temperature relies on heat released by metabolism
- ectotherm: body temperature relies on environmental heat sources
Torpor: decreased body temperature and metabolic rate
- daily or lasting days to weeks
- hibernation: long, during winter
- aestivation: long, during summer

Beau Geste hypothesis: some birds utilize big song repertoires to simulate higher population

#Gender

#Gamete
Male: large number, small, motile
Female: low number, large, non-motile

Bruce effect: pregnancy termination following exposure to unfamiliar male (rodents)
Nonparental infanticide: male killing youngs fathered by other males (carnivores)

#Vision
Binocular: eyes in same direction, 3-dimensional image
- birds of prey, carnivorous mammals, primates
Monocular: eyes on opposite sides, independent movement, wider field
