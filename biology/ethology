#Evolution
Extinction debt: dead clade walking, species likely to become extinct in future (panda)

Pioneer species: first to (re)populate barren environments

Signalling theory: communication between individuals within and across species
- Handicap principle: honest signal that is costly (peacock tail)
Evolutionary stable strategy (ESS): once fixed in population natural selection prevents it being replaced by alternatives
Sexual selection: evolutionary pressure within species
- males: frequent mating, monopolizing access to females
- females: selecting best males
- sexual dimorphism: ornate plumage, antlers
- Fisherian runaway: positive feedback loop in trait preference (peacock)
- Fisher's principle: equilibrium ratio 1:1 of males:females because it is ESS

#Mating
Apomixis: asexual, without fertilisation, plants
Autogamy: self-fertilisation, flowering plants
Monogamy: male + female pair (beaver, wolf, swan, eagle, owl)
Polygamy
- Polygyny: male + multiple females (gorilla, deer, lion, elephant)
- Polyandry: female + multiple males (insects)
Promiscuity: within group, no pair bond (pig, chimpanzee, dolphin)

r/K selection theory: quality vs quantity of offspring
- r-selection: many offspring (rodents, insects)
- K-selection: high survival probability (elephant, whale, eagle)

#Communication
Bird songs: mate attraction, territory defense, alarm, mobbing call

Aposematism: advertising danger to predators (poison frogs)
Camouflage: making hard to see (chameleon, octopus)
Deimatism: distracting predator (butterfly eyespots)
Alarm signal: warning of predator, social animals (birds, primates)

#Mimicry: evolved resemblance to another object / organism
Aggressive: predator avoids identification (anglerfish)
Batesian: harmless mimics harmful (hoverflies)
MÃ¼llerian: shares honest warning signal (predator learns faster)
Mertensian/Emsleyan: deadly prey mimics less-deadly (predator can survive and learn)
Vavilovian: weed resembles crop

Thermoregulation
- larger animals conserve heat better, lower surface-area to volume ratio
- slower metabolism and longer lifespan in cold
- Bergmann's rule: species within clade are larger in colder environment
- Allen's rule: animals in colder environment have shorter thicker limbs
- Deep-sea gigantism: temperature lowers with depth
- homeotherm: stable internal body temperature
- poikotherm: variable internal body temperature
- endotherm: body temperature relies on heat released by metabolism
- ectotherm: body temperature relies on environmental heat sources
Torpor: decreased body temperature and metabolic rate
- daily or lasting days to weeks
- hibernation: long, during winter
- aestivation: long, during summer

Beau Geste hypothesis: some birds utilize big song repertoires to simulate higher population

#Gender

#Gamete
Male: large number, small, motile
Female: low number, large, non-motile

Bruce effect: pregnancy termination following exposure to unfamiliar male (rodents)
Nonparental infanticide: male killing youngs fathered by other males (carnivores)


#Vision
Binocular: eyes in same direction, 3-dimensional image
- birds of prey, carnivorous mammals, primates
Monocular: eyes on opposite sides, independent movement, wider field

#Coloration
Point coloration: dark extremities (face, tail, ears, legs)

#Sex-determination system
Haplodiploidy: Hymenoptera, haploid males, diploid females
- sex determined by number of chromosome sets
- female queen and workers, male drones
- sisters share 3/4 of genes, daughter only 1/2

#Symbiosis: interaction between organisms
=Predation: predator kills and eats prey
Pursuit: higher speed or endurance (wolf, hyena, dolphin, raptors)
Ambush: stealth (frog, crocodile, snake, cat)
Ballistic interception: chameleon
Pack hunter: in group (lion, hyena, wolf, chimpanzee, dolphin)
Cooperative: american badger and coyote sometimes hunt in tandem (cover both under and overground)
=Mutualism: both species benefit
- e.g. gut flora, pollination, plant roots andf fungi, clownfish and sea anemone
Ants: cultivate fungi (leafcutter ants) or aphids (honeydew)
Acacia ant (Pseudomyrmex): protect acacia tree, nest in hollow thorns, leaves produce nectar for ants
- Beltian body: nutritious packets on tips of leaves
Tarantulas and frogs (Microhylidae): spider protects frog and provides shelter, frog protects eggs from ants
=Commensalism: one species is unaffected and other benefits
- e.g. spider webs on plants
=Amensalism: one species is unaffected and other is harmed
Allelopathy: plants releasing inhibitor chemicals to soil
=Parasitism: parasite benefits by causing harm to host
Brood parasitism: raising young of same/another species as own
- Egg mimicry + Egg tossing: cuckoos
- Slaver ants: raiding nests to increase working force
Parasitoid: living at host's expenses until host's death, e.g. wasp laying eggs in host
Micropredator: multiple hosts, causes small harm, often feeding on blood
Social parasitism
- Emery's rule: social parasits are closely related to their hosts
Hyperparasite: parasite's host is also parasitee
Transmission
- Vector transmitted: usually microorganisms spread by hematophagic arthropods
- Trophically transmitted: spread by being eaten, parasitic worms
- Directly transmitted: spread by contact, e.g. lice or mites
Obligate parasite: relies on host to reproduce, viruses or helminths
Facultative parasite: can reproduce without host, fungi

#Dominance hierarchy: ranked order in group, reduces fights
affects reproduction, territory, access to resources
fight: risks of injury vs benefits

=Migration: long distance seasonal movement
Birds: north-south, magnetic field + sun compass
Monarch butterfly: multiple generations within migration
Salmon: saltwater to freshwater
Sea turtle: breading beeches
Diel vertical migration (DVM): movement between surface (night) and depth (day) of lakes/oceans, driven by light intensity

=Speciation
Allochronic: different breeding time
Allopatric: geographically separated populations
Peripatric: isolated peripheral population
Parapatric: hybrid zone
Sympatric: same region
Endemism: species found in single location, often island or mountain

#Constructions
Beaver: build dams as shelter, restrict water flow
- made of tree branches, rocks and mud
Caddisfly: larvae create portable cases for protection
- made of silk and plant material, rocks or snail shells

#Ecology
Island effect / Foster's rule: different size of animals on islands
- Island gigantism: species become larger due to missing predators
- Island dwarfism: species become smaller due to limited resources

Kleiber's law: metabolic rate decreases with size
Sexual bimaturism: different development timing between genders within species
- females usually reach sexual maturity earlier
