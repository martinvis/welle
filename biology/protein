#Protein: activity depends on 3D structure

#Signaling - Receptor: change cell behaviour when activated
Transmembrane
- Ion channel linked: controlled by neurotransmitters (Na+, K+, Ca+)
- Enzyme-linked: catalytic, growth factors and insulin
- G protein-coupled: 7 helices
Intracellular
- Transcription factors: control transcription from DNA to mRNA

#Transcription factors: ~10% of proteins
Autoimmune regulator (AIRE): eliminates self-reactive T cells
T-box transcription factor T (TBXT): defines anterior-posterior axis, spine development

#Receptors
Trk receptors: tyrosine kinases, regulate synaptic strength and plasticity

#Signaling - Transmitter
#Neurotransmitter: neuron synapse
Amino acid
- glutamate: most abundant
- aspartate
- D-serine
- GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid): inhibitory, chloride
- glycine: inhibitory, chloride
Gas: NO, CO, H2S
Indolamine
- Serotonin
- Melatonin
Catecholamine
- Dopamine
- Adrenaline
- Noradrenaline
Peptide
- Oxytocin
- Somatostatin
- Substance P
- CART (cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript)
- Opioids: like endorphins
- Endorphins: inhibit pain, block substance P and GABA

#Signaling
Defensin: antimicrobial and immune signaling
Cytokine: small, do not cross cell membrane, interact with receptors on cell surface
- Chemokine: guide direction of cell movement by change in concentration
- Interferon: released by host cells in response to virus presence, inhibit protein synthesis, increase MHC expression
- Interleukin: produced by leukocytes
- Lymphokine: produced by lymphocytes
- Pyrogene: interleukins, induce fever, migrate to brain (hypothalamus)

#Antibody / Immunoglobulin (Ig)
immune system
large, Y-shaped, two antigen binding sites
identifies and neutralizes foreign objects
identifies antigen (unique molecule of pathogen)
paratope of protein binds to epitope of antigen
neutralize pathogen by blocking parts of its surface
clump pathogens together (two binding sites)
encourage complement system and attract phagocytosis

IgA: mucous membranes, most numerous, 2 units, do not activate complement system, in maternal milk
IgD: B cells membrane, activate other lymphocytes
IgE: plasma cells, against parasitic worms, cause allergy
IgG: plasma cells, most common, cross to fetus and protect newborn
IgM: plasma cells, first response, 5 units, activate complement system

#Muscle contraction
Actin
Actinin (ACTN): attachment of actin myofilaments to Z-lines
Myosin (MYO*)
Titin (TTN): large size, functions as spring, contraction of striated muscle tissue
Troponin + Tropomyosin: regulate muscle contraction
- Troponin only in skeletal/cardiac muscles

#Enzyme
biological catalyst

#Kinase: enzyme, catalyzes transfer of phosphates from ATP
Tyrosine kinase: functional on/off switch in cell
Serine/threonine kinases: cell differentiation, apoptosis

Hydrolase: hydrolysis
- Protease: breaking down proteins
Oxidoreductase: oxidation/reduction
Isomerase: isomerization
Ligase: joining by bond
Lyase: other breaking of bond
Transferase: transfering functional group
Translocase: movement across membrane

#Serine protease
Elastase: breaks down elastin
Thrombin (F2): converts fibrinogen to fibrin
Trypsin: digestion, cuts protein into smaller pieces

#Hormone
Leptin: made by adipocytes, regulates energy balance
Adiponectin: made by adipocytes, regulates glucose level and fatty acid breakdown
Angiotensin: made by liver, causes vasoconstriction and thirst, increases blood pressure
Vasopressin

#Structural - Extracellular
Mucins (MUC)
- high molecular weight proteins
- produced by epithelial tissues
- form gels, control mineralization
- defense against infections

Collagen (COL): long lived
- connective tissues: skin, bones, tendons
- most abundant in body (~30%)
- triple helix form, 30% is Glycine, 20% is Hydroxyproline+Proline
Elastin (ELN): amorphous, long lived
- pressure wave propagation in arteries
- lung, bladder and skin flexibility
Fibrillin (FBN1): scaffold for elastin
Biglycan (BGN)
Decorin (DCN)

#Structural - Cytoskeleton

=Microfilament, double helix structure
- Actin

=Intermediate filament
- Keratin (KRT*) in hair, nail, beak, claw, horn, hoof, feather
- Vimentin (VIM) mesenchymal cells, positioning organelles
- Desmin (DES) in sarcomeres

=Microtubule
Tubulin (TUB*): structural support, DNA segregation

#Structural
Spectrin (SPT*)
Fibrin
Fibrinogen

#Transport
Hemoglobin (HBA/HBB): in erythrocytes, carries oxygen
- highly soluble in water
- heme degrades into bilirubin
Cytoglobin (CYGB): oxygen transfer to brain
Ferroportin: transports iron
Sodiumâ€“potassium pump: exports Na+ and imports K+, controls cell volume, maintains ion concentrations
Albumins: globular
- Serum albumin: bind hormones, fatty acids and drugs
- Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): in fetus, bind bilirubin and fatty acids
- D-binding (DBP): bind vitamin D
Serotonin transporter (SERT): serotonin reuptake, repeat length gene polymorphism

#Storage
Ferritin (FTL/FTH) - intracellular, stores iron
Myoglobin (MB), in muscle tissue, binds iron and oxygen, stores oxygen
