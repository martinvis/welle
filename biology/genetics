#Connective tissue
Elastic fibers = Fibrillin (FBN1) + Elastin (ELN)
Collagen fibers = Collagen (COL1)

#Muscle tissue
Actin + Myosin: muscle contraction
Troponin + Tropomyosin: regulatory
Titin (TTN), giant size, molecular spring

#Nervous tissue
Central + Peripheral nervous system
Neuron cells (receive/transmit impulses) + Glial cells (provide nutritients)
Neurons = Soma + Dendrites (receive signal) + Axon (single, send signal)
- Sensory
- Motor
- Interneuron
Myelin sheath (covers some axons, speeds up electric impulse)


#Epithelial tissue


##Cell

#Cytoskeleton
Microfilament, double helix structure
- Actin
Intermediate filament
- Keratin (KRT*) in hair, nail, beak, claw, horn, hoof, feather
- Vimentin (VIM) in leukocytes, fibroblasts etc
- Desmin (DES) in sarcomeres
Microtubule


Ferritin (FTL/FTH) - intracellular protein, stores iron
Hemoglobin (HBA/HBB) - transport protein, in erythrocytes, carries oxygen
- heme degrades into bilirubin


##Immune system : innate + adaptive
#Leukocytes
Macrophage, digest pathogens
Lymphocyte
- T cells, adaptive immune response
- B cells, humoral immunity, produce antibodies
- natural killer cells, release cytotoxic granules inducing apoptosis or cell lysis
Granulocyte, innate
- Neutrophil, most abundant, short-lived, highly mobile
- Basophil, least common, largest, parasite defense, cause allergy

#T cells
helper CD4+
regulatory CD4+
cytotoxic CD8+
memory

#B cells
plasmablast, short-lived, generated early in infection
plasma cell, long-lived, generated later in infection
memory, initiate antibody response
regulatory

Perforin (PRF1), cytolytic protein in granules of cytotoxic lymphocytes



Melatonin, controls sleep-wake cycle, synthesized from serotonin
Cortisol, increased in stress, increases blood sugar, suppresses immune system, reduces bone formation
Serotonin, neurotransmitter, derives from tryptophan
Niacin = Vitamin B3, synthesized from tryptophan via Kynurenine

Norepinephrine = Noradrenaline, precursor is phenylalanine, increases alertness and heart rate / blood pressure
Epinephrine = Adrenaline, precursor is phenylalanine, increases blood flow to muscles and blood sugar level
Melanin, precursor is phenylalanine, pigment, protection against UV radiation
Dopamine (DA), precursor is phenylalanine, neurotransmitter, part of reward system, dysfunction causes Parkinson's disease

###Endocrine system
operates via feedback loops
##Hormones
##Pancreas
Insulin (INS), produced by beta cells in pancreatic islets, lowers glucose level
Glucagon (GCG), produced by alpha cells in pancreatic islets, raises glucose level
##Hypothalamus
links nervous and endocrine systems via hypophysis
controls body temperature, hunger, thirst, fatigue, circadian rhythm
Oxytocin (OXT) - role in childbirth, social bonding
Vasopressin (AVP) - increases amount of water reabsorbed into circulation in kidneys
Releasing hormons - stimulate/inhibit hormone secretion in hypophysis
Dopamine
##Hypophysis / Pituitary gland
controls growth, blood pressure, sex organs, temperature regulation, metabolism, pain relief
releases oxytocin, vasopressin
Somatotropin/Growth hormone
Thyroid-stimulating hormone
Prolactin (PRL)
Adrenocorticotropic hormone - produced in biological stress, stimulates production of melanin
Gonadotropins - glycoprotein hormones
- Follicle-stimulating hormone - stimulates maturation of germ cells
- Luteinizing hormone - triggers ovulations, stimulates production of androgens
##Epiphysis / Pineal gland
produces melatonin, simulated by darkness and inhibited by light
has profuse blood flow
##Thyroid
butterfly shaped, two connected lobes
Triiodothyronine (T3) + Thyroxine (T4), tyrosine-based, regulate metabolism, contain iodine
Levothyroxine = manufactured form of Thyroxine
Hashimoto's thyroiditis = autoimmune disease, destroys Thyroid
#Adrenal glands - above kidneys
Adrenaline
Cortisol
Aldosterone - stimulates Na+ and water reabsorption, K+ and H+ secretion

#Huntington's chorea
type: neurodegenerative disease
symptoms: uncoordinated hyperkinetic movements, dementia
cause: inherited, excessive CAG repeats in Huntingtin gene (HTT)
mechanism: damage in basal ganglia

#Parkinson's disease
type: neurodegenerative
symptoms: tremor, slowness of movement, dementia
cause: misfolded proteins
mechanism: cell death in basal ganglia

#Tourette syndrome
type: neurodevelopmental
symptoms: movement and vocal tics

#Fragile X syndrome
symptoms: intellectual disability
cause: inherited, excessive CGG repeats in FMR1 gene on X chromosome

#Swyer syndrome
type: XY hypogonadism
symptoms: female phenotype, no progesteron, no eggs, 
cause: mutation in SRY and other genes

#Phenylketonuria
type: metabolism disorder
symptoms: intellectual disability, mental disorders
mechanism: decreased metabolism of phenylalanine
cause: recessive inherited, mutation in PAH gene

#Adenosine deaminase deficiency
type: metabolic disorder
symptoms: immunodeficiency, underdeveloped thymus
mechanism: accumulation of deoxyadenosine, buildup of dATP in cells
cause: recessive inherited, mutation in ADA gene
