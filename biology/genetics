Phylogenetics: evolutionary history of life

Mendelian inheritance
- Law of dominance and uniformity: dominant allele takes effect over recessive allele (sometimes intermediate effect)
- Law of segregation: gametes carry only one allele (reoccurence of grandparent characteristics)
- Law of independent assortment: alleles in gametes are passed independently (not when close to each other on chromosome)
