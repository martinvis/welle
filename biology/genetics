on stimulation, protease cleaves protein to releases cytokines, initiates cascade
opsionizes and kills pathogens
stimulates phagocytes, inflammation, activates membrane attack complex
classical pathway:
- activation of C1 complex by IgM or IgG complexed with antigens
- C1 complex: C1q + 2 C1r + 2 C1s (C1qr2s2)
- C1 complex splits C4 and C2
- C4b + C2b bind and cleave C3
- C4b2b bind C3 and cleave C5
alternative pathway:
- C3 -> C3a + C3b
- C3b binds microbe or is inactivated by factors H and I
- C3b acts as opsonin, induces phagocytosis
- bound C3b binds factor B, factor D cleaves Ba and leaves C3bBb
- C3bBb binds factor P and cleaves C3
- C3bBbC3bP cleaves C5 to C5a + C5b (initiates MAC)
lectin pathway

regulatory CD4+
cytotoxic CD8+: killer T cell, kill cancerous cells and cells infected by pathogens
- activated by MHC class I
- two step activation, first by dentritic cell and second by T helper cell

#B cells: mature in bone marrow, when activated rapidly produce antibodies to antigen
- recognize antigens directly, wider range of antigens than T cells
- recognition is easier when antigens are coated by complement system
- aborbed antigen is broken down to various small pieces that are presented to T cells
- two step activation, first by antigen and second by T helper cell
Somatic hybermutation (SHM): affects variable regions of immunoglobulin genes to produce better antibodies
plasmablast: short-lived, generated early in infection, after first activation
