#Diagnosis
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): uses strong magnetic fields
- better contrast in soft tissues (brain)
- in long tube, without implants and metal objects
Computed tomography scan (CT): uses rotating X-ray tube
Positron emission tomography (PET): uses radioactive substances
- imaging of tumors, radiotracer FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose)
Ultrasound scan: uses sound waves
Blood test: blood from vein
- arterial blood gas (BGA): O2 and CO2
- kidney function: electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, HCO3), urea, glucose and creatinine
- liver function: albumin, bilirubin
- blood count: count of cells
- crossmatching: blood compatibility
Urine test: hormones, drugs, pregnancy
Blood pressure measurement: systolic/diastolic
Body temperature
Respiratory rate
Pulse rate

#Therapy
Intravenous therapy: fluids administered into vein (water, electrolytes, nutritients etc)

- Type IV: cell mediated (T cells, macrophages)

#autoimmune type II
Bullous pemphigoid: blisters and itchy skin, antigen in keratinocytes

#autoimmune type III
Lupus
- symptoms: swollen joints, hair loss, red rash

#autoimmune type IV

- diagnosis: low sodium, high potassium

Lichen planus
- affects skin and mucous membranes
- flat topped polygonal purple areas of papules and plaques
Lichen sclerosus
- anal and genital areas, white flat patches
Vitiligo
- patches of skin without pigment

#neurodegenerative
Alzheimer's disease: loss of neuronal connections, causes dementia
- symptoms: memory loss
Parkinson's disease
- symptoms: tremor, slowness of movement, dementia
- cause: misfolded proteins
- mechanism: cell death in basal ganglia
Multiple sclerosis: damage of myelin sheaths

#neurological
Epilepsy: recurrent seizures due to excessive electrical discharges in brain
- can be observed by EEG
- temporal lobe epilepsy: causes changes in personality

#other
Lactose intolerance: common in east asia

Urolithiasis (kidney stone): mineral crystal formed in kidney, can block ureter
- symptoms: renal colic
- risk factors: dehydration, high sugar or sodium intake
- types: calcium oxalate (60%), calcium phosphate, uric acid

Urinary incontinence: uncontrolled urine leakage

Sepsis: blood poisoning, caused by microorganisms, high risk of death
- symptoms: fever, increased heart rate

#congitive disorder
Agnosia: inability to process sensory information
- Anosognosia: unawareness of disability
- Prosopagnosia: inability to recognize faces
Synesthesia: stimulation of one sensory pathways leads to involuntary experience in second
