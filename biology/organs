Homeostasis: state of steady internal conditions
- body temperature, fluid balance, electolytes, blood sugar
Perfusion: supply of blood to tissue in time

#Integumentary system
Skin
- 15% of body weight, surface area 2m^2
- acidic pH around 5
Epidermis
- thin outer skin layer, constantly renews itself
- function: protection, homeostasis
- contains melanocytes
- without blood supply
- stratum corneum: dead keratinized cells without nuclei and organelles, fall off
- stratum granulosum: secretes lipids and proteins creating hydrophobic envelope
- stratum spinosum: synthesizes cytokeratins forming strong connection between cells
- stratum basale: cells continually divide, large nucleus, move to surface in a month
Dermis
- thick inner skin layer
- contains glands, nerve endings, hair roots and blood vessels
- sweat glands regulate temperature and remove waste by secreting water and salts
- sweat also contains lactic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, uric acid and urea
Hypodermis
- inner skin layer
- stores fats, passive heat insulation
- composed of adipocytes
Hair
- composed of keratin
- grows from hair follicle
- sebaceous gland secretes acidic oil
- hair erector muscle attached to follicle causes hair to stand (goose bumps)
- Terminal hair: thick and long, on scalp
- Vellus hair: short and thin, on body

#Respiratory system
Lungs
- surface area ~60m2
- alveoli: small air sacs, actual air exchange, 90% of volume

#Nervous system
Brain
Brainstem
Cerebellum
Thalamus: paired
- consciousness, sleep
Basal ganglia
- motor movement, learning, habit formation
Cerebral cortex: 90% neocortex + 10% allocortex, two folded hemispheres
- attention, perception, cognition, memory, language
- lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital, limbic
- occipital: vision
#Limbic system
Hippocampus: paired
- navigation, short to long term memory
Amygdala: almond shaped pair, within temporal lobes
- memory processing, emotional response, decision making, reward system

#Visual system: sight
Cornea: transparent front layer, covers iris
Sclera: white, protective outer layer
Retina: back part, light sensitive, neuron layers
- Macula lutea: in center, pigmented area
- Fovea centralis: center of macula, sharp vision
Lens: transparent, focuses light on retina, changes focal length
Uvea: between retina and sclera, provides nutrition
- Iris: controls pupil size, defines eye color
- Pupil: hole in center of iris
- Ciliary body: produces humor, muscle controls lens
- Choroid: absorbs reflected light
Aqueous humor: transparent fluid, between lens and cornea
Vitreous humor: transparent gel, between lens and retina
Photoreceptive cells: light sensitive neurons in retina
- Rods: outer edge, peripheral vision, can function in lower light
- Cones: in center, color vision, need bright light, three types (570nm, 540nm, 430nm)

#Auditory system: hearing
Outer ear
- Auricle / Pinna: collects sound
- Ear canal: pathway from outer to middle ear
Tympanic membrane / Eardrum: membrane between outer and middle ear
Middle ear: three small bones (ossicles), transmit and amplify vibrations
- Malleus: from eardrum to incus
- Incus: from malleus to stapes
- Stapes: connected to oval window, smallest bone
Inner ear: bony labyrinth
- Semicircular canals: three interconnected canals with fluid, motion sensors
- Cochlea: hollow spiral with fluid, converts motion to neuron signals
