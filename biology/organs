Homeostasis: state of steady internal conditions
- body temperature, fluid balance, electolytes, blood sugar
Perfusion: supply of blood to tissue in time

#Integumentary system
Skin
- 15% of body weight, surface area 2m^2
- acidic pH around 5
Epidermis
- thin outer skin layer, constantly renews itself
- function: protection, homeostasis
- contains melanocytes
- without blood supply
- stratum corneum: dead keratinized cells without nuclei and organelles, fall off
- stratum granulosum: secretes lipids and proteins creating hydrophobic envelope
- stratum spinosum: synthesizes cytokeratins forming strong connection between cells
- stratum basale: cells continually divide, large nucleus, move to surface in a month
Dermis
- thick inner skin layer
- contains glands, nerve endings, hair roots and blood vessels
- sweat glands regulate temperature and remove waste by secreting water and salts
- sweat also contains lactic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, uric acid and urea
Hypodermis
- inner skin layer
- stores fats, passive heat insulation
- composed of adipocytes
Hair
- composed of keratin
- grows from hair follicle
- sebaceous gland secretes acidic oil
- hair erector muscle attached to follicle causes hair to stand (goose bumps)
- Terminal hair: thick and long, on scalp
- Vellus hair: short and thin, on body

#Respiratory system
Lungs
- surface area ~60m2
- alveoli: small air sacs, actual air exchange, 90% of volume
