#Learning
Forgetting curve: decline of memory retention in time, if not reviewed
Learning curve: relationship between experience and proficiency
Spaced repetition: flashcards, shows difficult more and easy less frequently
Eidetic / photographic memory: ability to recall image with high precision after seeing it once
Mnemonic device: technique aiding information retention or retrieval
- Method of loci: uses visualization of familiar space

Affect heuristic: quick emotional decision, leads to biases
Flow: fully focused mental state, enjoyment of activity
- optimal challenge, immediate feedback, high motivation

Empathy: emotional understanding of others
Theory of mind (ToM): cognitive understanding others
- Sally–Anne test: understanding other can hold false beliefs (toy hidden in absence - what will other think), age 4+
- Perspective-taking: viewing situation from another's point of view (simulation)

Affect: observable expression of feelings
- Valence: positive to negative spectrum of experience, approach or avoid (direction)
- Arousal: high to low spectrum of experience (sympathetic nervous system), how much energy (urgency)
- Euphoria: high arousal + positive valence, happiness, dopamine (hunt)
- Inner peace / Peace of mind: low arousal + positive valence, content, serotonine (rest)
- Fight-or-flight / Acute stress response: high arousal + negative valence, anger/fear, adrenaline (escape)
- Depression: low arousal + negative valence, chronic stress, sadness (give up)
Reduced affect display / Emotional blunting: failure to express feelings, flat affect, excessive serotonine
Apathy / Indifference: lack of feelings, lack of dopamine

Construal level theory (CLT): abstract thinking of more distant objects, and concrete of closer
Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD): negative self-beliefs, interpersonal difficulties

#Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
reduces depression and anxiety
focuses on thought distortions and maladaptive behaviours
considers beliefs about self, others and future
thoughts, emotions and behaviours influence each other
needs positive therapeutic relationship
discovers answers by asking questions

#Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)
treats mood disorders, self-harm and suicidal thoughts
mindfulness, accept emotions
distress tolerance, emotion regulation

#Exposure therapy
treats fear by progressively stronger stimuli

#Internal Family Systems Model (IFS)
mind is made up of discrete subpersonalities
- exiles: psychological trauma
- managers: protective role
- firefighters: divert attention from exiles, inappropriate behaviour

#Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)
focus on traumatic memory during side-to-side eye movements

#Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT)
focus on trauma or fear
acupressure points stimulation

#Neurofeedback
electrically reinforced desired brain states

#Purple hat therapy
established therapy mixed with new addition with same effectiveness
addition is unnecessary

Neuroplasticity: ability of brain to change by making new neuron connections
Yerkes–Dodson law: relationship between arousal and performance (medium arousal is optimal)
Brainwaves: oscillations of neural activity in CNS
- Delta wave: 0.5-4 Hz, NREM sleep
- Theta wave: 4-8 Hz, REM sleep, memory formation
- Alpha wave: 8-12 Hz, relaxation
- Beta wave: 12-30 Hz, active thinking
- Gamma wave: 30-140 Hz, attention
- Mu wave: 8-12 Hz, movement

Cocktail party effect: attention focus on particular stimulus (selective hearing)

Four temperaments: Galen, ancient personality types, named after bodily humours
- Sanguine: social, optimistic
- Choleric: intense, impatient
- Melancholic: serious, pessimistic
- Phlegmatic: calm, passive
