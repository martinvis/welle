#Learning
Forgetting curve: decline of memory retention in time, if not reviewed
Learning curve: relationship between experience and proficiency
Spaced repetition: flashcards, shows difficult more and easy less frequently
Eidetic / photographic memory: ability to recall image with high precision after seeing it once
Mnemonic device: technique aiding information retention or retrieval
- Method of loci: uses visualization of familiar space

Affect heuristic: quick emotional decision, leads to biases

Neuroplasticity: ability of brain to change by making new neuron connections
Yerkesâ€“Dodson law: relationship between arousal and performance (medium arousal is optimal)
Brainwaves: oscillations of neural activity in CNS
- Delta wave: 0.5-4 Hz, NREM sleep
- Theta wave: 4-8 Hz, REM sleep, memory formation
- Alpha wave: 8-12 Hz, relaxation
- Beta wave: 12-30 Hz, active thinking
- Gamma wave: 30-140 Hz, attention
- Mu wave: 8-12 Hz, movement

Cocktail party effect: attention focus on particular stimulus (selective hearing)
