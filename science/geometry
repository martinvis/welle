Circle
- special type of ellipse (single focus point)
- eccentricity 0
Ellipse
- locus of points with constant distance from two focus points
- eccentricity 0 to 1
Parabola
- locus of points equidistant from focus and straight directrix
- special type of hyperbola (directrix with infinite radius)
- eccentricity 1
Hyperbola
- locus of points with constant difference of distances from two focus points
- locus of points equidistand from focus and circular directrix
- eccentricity over 1

#Circle
- x*x + y*y = r*r
- x = a + cos t, y = b + sin t
- Area: π*r*r
- Perimeter: 2*π*r (circumference)
Arc: part of circle
Secant: straing line sharing two points with circle
Tangent: straing line sharing one point with circle
Radius (r): distance to center
Diameter (d): 2x radius

#Semicircles
Arbelos: 3 semicircles, centers on straight line
Crescent: symmetric, 2 semicircles
Salinon: symmetric, 4 semicircles, centers on straight line

#Triangle
- area: 1/2 * base * height
- sum of angles is 180
Circumcircle: passing all vertices
- Circumcenter: center of circumcircle, intersection of perpendicular bisectors
Incircle: tangent to all edges
- Incenter: center of incircle, intersection of angle bisectors
Hypotenuse: edge opposite to right angle
Trigonometric function
- relate angle of right-angle triangle to ratio of two sides
- Sine: opposite to hypotenuse
- Cosine: adjacent to hypotenuse
- Tangent: opposite to adjacent
- Cosecant: sine reciprocal
- Secant: cosine reciprocal
- Cotangent: tangent reciprocal
Right-angle triangle
- Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (where c is hypotenuse)
- Pythagorean triple: side lengths of right-angle triangle
Primitive Pythagorean triple: a/b/c are coprime
- smallest triple is 3,4,5
- exactly one of a/b/c is dividible by each of 3/4/5
- 60 is largest dividor of a*b*c

#Polygon: 2D shape, closed lines connecting points
- n-polygon can be split into n-2 triangles
Triangle: 3 vertices
Pentagon: 5 vertices
Hexagon: 6 vertices

Euclidean geometry: flat plane
Elliptic geometry: surface of sphere
- all lines intersect (no parallel lines)
Hyperbolic geometry: parallel lines only share one point
- infinitely many parallel lines through one point
- infinitely many non-parallel non-intersecting lines
Poincaré disk model: 2D hyperbolic geometry
- straight lines are arcs within disc orthogonal to disc boundary
Klein disk model: 2D hyperbolic geometry
- straight lines are chords within disc
