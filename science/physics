#Atoms
Element: defined by number of protons
Isotope: atomic variant (number of neutrons)
Isobar: atoms of different element with same atomic number
Ion: electrically charged atom (number of electrons)
Cation: ion with more protons than electrons
Anion: ion with more electrons than protons

#Particles
Electron: negative charge, orbit nucleus
Proton: positive charge, in nucleus, 1836 times mass of electron
Neutron: neutral, in nucleus
Photon: quantum of electromagnetic field, massless, chargeless
Fermions: odd half-integer spin, quarks and leptons
Bosons: integer spin, force carriers
Quarks: up/down, top/bottom, strange/charm
Leptons: do not affected by strong force
Neutrinos: neutral leptons
Spin: amount of angular momentum
Atomic number (Z): number of protons
Mass number (A): number of protons and neutrons
Beta minus decay: neutron -> proton + electron + antineutrino
Beta plus decay: proton -> neutron + positron + neutrino

#Radiation
Alpha: helium nucleus
Beta: high speed electron
Gama: high energy ray

#Energy
Pressure: force per area (P = F/A)
Force: acceleration on mass (F = m*a)
Work: force per displacement (W = F*s)
Kinetic energy: energy caused by movement, 1/2 * m * v^2
Potential energy: energy caused by position, m * a * s
Thermal energy: energy caused by heat
Joul (J): unit of energy [kg * m^2 / s^2]
Calorie (cal): unit of energy, 4.18J

#Laws of thermodynamics
First: Total energy of isolated system is constant (conservation of energy)
Second: Heat moves from hotter object to colder object (increase of entropy)
Third: Entropy is lowest when temperature is absolute zero
Hess's law: heat change in reaction is independent of sequence of steps in reaction

#Heat capacity [J/K]
amount of energy needed to change temperature
specific = 1g of substance by 1K
molar = 1mol of substance by 1K
volumetric =  1m^3 of substance by 1K
high capacity: hydrogen, helium, ammonia, water, lithium
low capacity: lead, mercury, gold, platinum, tungsten

#Gravity
mutual attraction between all things
F = G * m1 * m2 / r^2

#General relativity
gravity is curvature of spacetime
gravivational lens: path of light follows curvature of spacetime
gravitational time dilation: light moves slower when gravity increases
gravitational waves: propagate at speed of light
