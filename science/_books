#Republic
You can not persuade someone that does not listen
Happiness without fulfilling desires
What is justice?
Justice without wealth or punishment?
Is it advantageous to be just?
Justice by rewarding good and punishing bad
Shepherd cares for sheep only to later slaughter it
Justice between criminals
Justice as purpose of life
