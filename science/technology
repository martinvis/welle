#Pulley
- wheel on axle with groove for cable
- supports movement and change of direction
- decreases required force by half
- used on cranes, sailing ships
Block and tackle: system of multiple pulleys

#Lever
- consist of rigid rod pivoted at fixed fulcrum
- small force at large distance causes large force at small distance
Class I: fulcrum between effort and resistance, crowbar or scissors, head
Class II: resistance between effort and fulcrum, advantage over 1, wheelbarrow or nutcracker, foot
Class III: effort between resistance and fulcrum, advantage below 1, tongs, mandible

#Turbine
- rotatory device with blades
- static part is stator, moving part is rotor
- extracts energy from fluid flow and converts it to work
- windmill or waterwheel
Impulse turbine: change direction of flow, diminishing kinetic energy, fixed nozzle
Reaction turbine: develop torque by lowering pressure of fluid, rotating nozzle

Nozzle: controls direction / pressure / speed of fluid

#Generator
- converts motive or chemical power into electricity
- rotor and stator form magnetic circuit
Dynamo: generate direct current
Alternator: generate alternating current

Photovoltaics: converts light into electricity

#Fuel cell
- converts chemical energy of fuel into electricity
- requires continuous source of fuel and oxygen
- consists of catode, anode and electrolyte

#Pump
- moves fluid by mechanical action
Positive-displacement pump: trap fixed amount of volume
- linear: long pipe, bottom immersed, fluid pulled along rope with knots
- rotary: rotating screws or gears, e.g. Archimedes screw
- reciprocating: high pressure seal and piston / plunger
- peristaltic: flexible tube in circular casing, rotary motion
Centrifugal pump: movement by rotational energy, high flow rate

#Centrifuge
- spinning fluid in container at high speed
- separation by density
- less dense displaced to center / top

#Siphon
- flow of liquid through tube, above surface and then below surface
- causes liquid to flow upward without pump

Screw: helical groove around outside, converts motion from rotational to linear

#Laser
- emits coherent light by optical amplification
- stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation
- laser printers, fiber-optic, optical litography, surgery, welding
Three-level laser: ineffective
Four-level laser: L1 (ground state), L2, L3, L4
- fast radiationless transition from L4 to L3, and from L2 to L1
- slow transition from L3 to L2
- L3 population higher than L2
- pump transition from L1 to L4

#Antenna
- conductors connected to transmitter or receiver
- converts electrical signals to electromagnetic waves (transmission)
- captures electromagnetic waves as electric signal (reception)

#Radio: information transmitted on radio waves
AM: amplitude modulation, longer distance
FM: frequency modulation, better quality

#Enriched uranium
- high percentage of U-235 isotope
- naturally occuring uranium is 99% isotope U-238
- fuel in nuclear reactors
- old method: gaseous diffusion of UF6, use of effusion
- new method: gas centrifuge of UF6
