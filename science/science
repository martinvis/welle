Deterministic model: without randomness
Stochastic model: with randomness

Algorithm: finite sequence of instructions to solve problem
Heuristic: simple approach to problem, leads to approximate solution

System: quantity of space or matter
- open: mass can change
- close: mass can not change
- isolated: no interactions
Surroundings: everything outside of system
Boundary: separates system and surroundings
Property: measurable characteristic of system
- extensive: additive, depends on system size (energy)
- intensive: not additive, has value at point (velocity)
State: complete description of system by properties
Interaction: exchange between system and surroundings
- transfer of extensive property
Process: change of state / properties
Conservation: some extensive properties are not created/destroyed
- mass, energy, charge, linear/angular momentum
