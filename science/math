Sieve of Eratosthenes

Integer number (N): positive, negative or zero
Natural number (Z): positive integer number
Rational number (Q): fraction of two integers
Real number (R): continuous one-dimensional
Complex number (C): real number with imaginary unit, two-dimensional

Prime number: natural number that is not product of two smaller natural numbers
Composite number: natural number that is product of two smaller natural numbers

Prime gap: difference between two successive prime numbers
Bertrand's postulate: ∀ integer n ∃ prime number p where n < p < 2n

Golden ratio (1.618): a+b / a = a / b

#Sequences
Fibonacci sequence: number is sum of two previous numbers, consecutive numbers converge to golden ratio

#Algebra
Scalar: single field element
- arithmetic operations: addition, substraction, multiplication, division
Vector: ordered list of elements
Matrix: 2-dimensional array of elements
- Transpose: flip over diagonal
- Inverse matrix: square matrix that gives identity matrix when multiplied with original matrix
Tensor: multi-dimensional array of elements

#Vector
Norm: measurement of vector size
- Manhattan norm (L1): sum(v_i)
- Euclidean norm (L2): sqrt(sum(v_i^2))
- Chebyshev norm (L∞): max(v_i)
Orthogonal vectors: perpendicular to each other, dot product is 0
Orthonormal vectors: orthogonal, vector size is 1

#Matrix
Singular matrix: not invertible
- when row/column elements are all zeroes
- when row/column elements are same/proportional to other row/column
- when row/column elements are linear combination of other rows/columns
Matrix multiplication: dot product of rows and columns
- Akl * Blm = Ckm, columns of first must match rows of second
- Cij = sum (Aik * Bkj)
- non-commutative, associative, distributive
Scalar multiplication: each element multiplied by scalar
Hadamard product: matrices with same dimensions, multiplication of corresponding elements
Determinant: only square matrix, zero if matrix is singular
- product of eigenvalues, measure of volume
- same for matrix and its transpose
- determinant of identity matrix is 1
- in scalar multiplication, determinant multiplies by scalar
- in matrix multiplication, determinant is product of determinants
- if position of two rowes/columns is switched, determinant changes sign
Symmetric matrix: equal to its transpose
Diagonal matrix: non-zero elements only on main diagonal
Orthogonal matrix: columns and rows are orthonormal vectors
- transpose is equal to inverse matrix
Diagonalizable matrix: if eigendecomposition exists
Trace: sum of elements on main diagonal
Moore–Penrose inverse (pseudoinverse)

Eigendecomposition: canonical form of square matrix, represented by eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- M = P * A * P^-1, A is diagonal matrix with eigenvalues, P is invertible matrix with eigenvectors as columns
- M^-1 = P * A^-1 * P^-1, if M is invertible

Singular value decomposition: canonical form of matrix
- M = U * S * V, S is rectagonal diagonal matrix, U and V are orthogonal matrices
- U and V represent rotation, S represents scaling

Jordan canonical form  (JCF): block diagonal matrix, each block represents eigenvalue, elements above diagonals are 1
Frobenius normal form: block diagonal matrix, each block represents polynomial, diagonal elements are 1 and last column has values
