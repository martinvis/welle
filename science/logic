#Cognitive bias: persistant thought processing errors
Anchoring bias: first (or last) acquired piece of information influencing decision
Apophenia: seeing meaningful connection between unrelated things
- Pareidolia: seeing object where none is, faces in inanimate objects (Face on Mars)
- Clustering illlusion: considering clusters in small samples to be non-random (stock market)
Confirmation bias: selecting information that confirms belief and ignoring contrary
- Cherry picking
Hard-Easy effect: overestimating success at hard task and underestimating success at easy task
- Dunning–Kruger effect: beginners overestimating and experts underestimating their skill
- Illusion of control (casino)
Narrative fallacy: creating story to explain events
- Hindsight bias: tendency to perceive past events as predictable (history)
Swimmer's body illusion: attributing trait to activity, instead of other way around
Sunk cost fallacy: continuing only because of previous investment (Concorde)
Contrast effect: effect of previous or simultaneos stimulus affecting perception (discounts)
Availability bias: heuristic, relying on information we remember (media coverage)
Outcome bias: evaluating decision when outcome is known (investments)
Egocentric bias: relying on own perspective
Loss aversion: loss more powerful than gain
- Endowment effect: object ownership increasing object value
Base rate fallacy: false positive vs true positive (medical test)

Association: mental connection
- Law of effect: rewarded behaviour repeats more and punished behaviour repeats less
- Classical conditioning: Pavlov, pairing of physiological and neutral stimulus

#Memory bias
Fading affect bias: forgetting negative quicker than positive (good old times)
Recency bias: favoring recent events over historic

#Propaganda/influence techniques
Ad hominem: attacking person instead of argument
Ad nauseum: tireless repetition of argument (Goebbels)
Argumentum ad verecundiam: appeal to authority (24 pairs of chromosomes)
Argumentum ad metum: appeal to fear
Argumentum ad populum: majority things so, bandwagon effect
Argumentum ad ignorantiam: absence of evidence vs evidence of absence
Pavlovian conditioning
Cult of personality: totalitarian/authoritarian/theocracy/monarchy (Mao Zedong, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Kim family)
Demonizing the enemy
Exaggeration
- Slippery slope/Boiling frog: asserts that small change leads to big consequences
False accusation
Scapegoating
False dilemma: reducing choice to two extremes (with me or against me)
Half-truth
Lying

#Influence
Peer pressure: imitation, fear of social rejection
- enforced by uncertainty and similar people
- Werther effect: copycat suicides after publicized suicide (some looking as accident)
Fear of missing out (FOMO): fear of regret, scarcity
- enforced by competition (auctions)
- Reactance: unpleasant reaction to limiting choice (banned books)
- Reverse psychology: asserting belief opposite to desired one (dares)
Reciprocity principle: responding to action with similar action (reward/punishment)
- feeling of debt even in case of unwanted favor
- reciprocal concessions: lowering request leads to concession from other side (compromise)
- Door-in-the-face technique: make large request (denied) and then smaller one (accepted)
Consistency principle: commitment, people want to be consistent with prior acts and statements
- larger request more likely agreed after agreeing to smaller request
- Foot-in-the-door technique: start with small request
Association principle: connection (sports fans, celebrities)
Liking principle: similarity, compliments, cooperation
Authority principle: credibility (titles, cloths)

Mass suicides
- Jonestown in Guyana, Peoples Temple cult, cyanide poisoning following murder of US congressman, 1978
- 47 rōnin, seppuku after avenging death of their master, 1703

Conspiracy theory: ignores more probable explanations, resists falsification, faith

#Logical fallacy: mistakes in reasoning
Circular reasoning: proving argument validity by itself
False equivalence/analogy: comparing based on unrelated shared trait (apples and oranges)
Gambler's/Monte Carlo: believing past events (statistically independent) affect probability in future
Selection bias: selecting samples not representative of population
- Survivorship bias: concentration on items passing selection process and overlooking rest (e.g. becoming movie star)
Simpson's paradox: different trends within groups of data and their combination (e.g. kidney stone treatments)
- caused by unequal representation within groups

#Causal fallacy: incorrectly identified causality
Cum hoc: correlation implying causation (lice are benefitial to health)
Jumping to conclusions: deciding without having all facts
Oversimplification: assuming single cause of outcome
Post hoc: assuming action is caused by event (rooster causes sun to rise)
- Regression to mean: assuming action is responsible for change to normal (praise is bad/criticism is good)
Texas sharpshooter: focusing on similarities in data, ignoring differences and randomness (Nostradamus prophecies)

#Unintended consequences
Perverse incentive: reward making issue worse (cobra effect)

#Other
Black swan: highly improbable consequential event
Problem of induction (Hume): drawing certainty from observations (Thanksgiving turkey)
Matthew effect
- rich get richer and poor get poorer
- preferential attachment: adding the most to the biggest
Long tail: power law distribution
- Pareto principle: 80/20 rule, 80% consequences from 20% causes
- popularity, wealth, city size
Fractal: detailed structure at arbitrarily small scale
- Mandelbrot set
- Sierpiński triangle: recursively subdivided equilateral triangle
- Menger sponge: recursively subdivided cube
Occam's razor: simplest explanation is often correct, lowest amount of assumptions
Diffusion of responsibility: person takes lower responsibility for action in group
- Bystander effect: group of bystanders less likely to help than individual

#Probability
Bayes' rule: probability of event based on another event, P(A when B) = P(B when A) * P(A)/P(B)
Laplace's rule of succession: probability of success based on previous results, P = successes+1 / total+2
#Probability distribution
Erlang distribution: 
- additive rule: constant probability into future
Normal distribution: 
- average rule: decreasing probability into future
Power law distribution: 
- multiplicative rule: increasing probability into future

#Marketing tricks
Christmas toys
- advertise toy, parent promises it to child
- toy is out of stock for christmas
- parent buys another toy instead
- advertise toy again after christmas
- parent buys it because of previous promise
Low balling
- seller offers product at discount
- customer becomes attached
- seller cancels on discount
- customer still buys
