#Cognitive bias: persistant thought processing errors
Anchoring bias: first (or last) acquired piece of information influencing decision
Apophenia: seeing meaningful connection between unrelated things
Confirmation bias: selecting information that confirms belief and ignoring contrary
- Cherry picking
Hard-Easy effect: overestimating success at hard task and underestimating success at easy task
- Dunning–Kruger effect: beginners overestimating and experts underestimating their skill
Narrative fallacy
Hindsight bias: tendency to perceive past events as predictable

#Propaganda/influence techniques
Ad hominem: attacking person instead of argument
Ad nauseum: tireless repetition of argument (Goebbels)
Argumentum ad verecundiam: appeal to authority (24 pairs of chromosomes)
Argumentum ad metum: appeal to fear
Argumentum ad populum: majority things so, bandwagon effect
Argumentum ad ignorantiam: absence of evidence vs evidence of absence
Pavlovian conditioning
Cult of personality: totalitarian/authoritarian/theocracy/monarchy (Mao Zedong, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Kim family)
Demonizing the enemy
Exaggeration
- Slippery slope/Boiling frog: asserts that small change leads to big consequences
False accusation
Scapegoating
False dilemma: reducing choice to two extremes (with me or against me)
Half-truth
Lying

#Influence
Peer pressure: fear of social rejection
Fear of missing out (FOMO): fear of regret, scarcity
Reciprocity principle: responding to action with similar action (reward/punishment)
- feeling of debt even in case of unwanted favor
- reciprocal concessions: lowering request leads to concession from other side (compromise)
- Door-in-the-face technique: make large request (denied) and then smaller one (accepted)
Consistency principle: people want to be consistent with prior acts and statements
- larger request more likely agreed after agreeing to smaller request
- Foot-in-the-door technique: start with small request
Liking principle
Authority principle

Conspiracy theory: ignores more probable explanations, resists falsification, faith

#Logical fallacy: mistakes in reasoning
Circular reasoning: proving argument validity by itself
False equivalence/analogy: comparing based on unrelated shared trait (apples and oranges)
Gambler's/Monte Carlo: believing past events (statistically independent) affect probability in future
Selection bias: selecting samples not representative of population
- Survivorship bias: concentration on items passing selection process and overlooking rest (e.g. becoming movie star)
Simpson's paradox: different trends within groups of data and their combination (e.g. kidney stone treatments)
- caused by unequal representation within groups

#Causal fallacy: incorrectly identified causality
Cum hoc: correlation implying causation (lice are benefitial to health)
Jumping to conclusions: deciding without having all facts
Oversimplification: assuming single cause of outcome
Post hoc: assuming action is caused by event (rooster causes sun to rise)
- Regression: assuming action is responsible for change to normal (praise is bad/criticism is good)
Texas sharpshooter: focusing on similarities in data, ignoring differences and randomness (Nostradamus prophecies)

#Other
Black swan: highly improbable consequential event
Problem of induction: 
Matthew effect
- rich get richer and poor get poorer
- preferential attachment: adding the most to the biggest
Long tail: power law distribution
- Pareto principle: 80/20 rule, 80% consequences from 20% causes
- popularity, wealth, city size
Fractal: detailed structure at arbitrarily small scale
- Mandelbrot set
- Sierpiński triangle: recursively subdivided equilateral triangle
- Menger sponge: recursively subdivided cube
Occam's razor: simplest explanation is often correct, lowest amount of assumptions
