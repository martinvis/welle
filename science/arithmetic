Number theory: integers and arithmetic functions
Operation: function from set to itself
- Successor: next natural number
- Predecessor: previous natural number
- Addition: sum of terms (summands), repeated successor
- Subtraction: difference between terms, repeated predecessor
- Multiplication: product of factors, repeated addition
- Division: quotient of dividend to divisor, repeated subtraction
- Exponentation: product of base to exponent, repeated multiplication
- Root extraction: root of radicand to degree, inverse of exponentation for base
- Logarithm: inverse of exponentation for exponent

Prime number: natural number that is not product of two smaller natural numbers
- Goldbach's conjecture: unproven, every even integer is sum of two primes
- Euclid's theorem: infinitely many primes, p1*p2*..*pn + 1
- sum of reciprocals of primes is divergent
- Mersenne prime: 2^p - 1, easier to test primality
- Sieve of Eratosthenes: find primes by removing prime multiples
- Prime gap: difference between two successive prime numbers
- Bertrand's postulate: ∀ integer n ∃ prime number p where n < p < 2n
Composite number: natural number that is product of two smaller natural numbers
Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every integer is unique product of prime factors

Twin prime: pair of primes with gap of two
- Twin prime conjecture: unproven, infinitely many twin primes
- Brun's theorem: sum of reciprocals of twin primes is convergent
- Polignac's conjecture: infinitely many consecutive primes with any even-length gap
Cousin prime: pair of primes with gap of four
Sexy prime: pair of primes with gap of six
Prime constellation: k-tuple of consecutive primes with smallest possible sum of gaps

Practical number: all smaller integers are sum of its distinct divisors (10 is not)
Aliquot sum: sum of all proper divisors
- Perfect number: equal to sum of its proper divisors (e.g. 6 or 28)
- Deficient number: greater than sum of its proper divisors
- Abundant number: less than sum of its proper divisors

=Lucas sequence: recursive, x_n = P * x_n-1 - Q * x_n-2

Lucas numbers: 2/1/P+Q, ratio of consecutive terms approach golden ratio
Pell numbers: 0/1/2P+Q, Pell / Pell-Lucas fractions approach square root of two
Pell–Lucas numbers: 2/2/2P+Q
Jacobsthal number: 0/1/P+2Q
Mersenne numbers: 0/1/3P-2Q, 2^n-1
