Number theory: integers and arithmetic functions
Operation: function from set to itself
- Successor: next natural number

- Division: quotient of dividend to divisor, repeated subtraction
- Exponentation: product of base to exponent, repeated multiplication
- Root extraction: root of radicand to degree, inverse of exponentation for base
- Logarithm: inverse of exponentation for exponent

Prime number: natural number that is not product of two smaller natural numbers
- Goldbach's conjecture: unproven, every even integer is sum of two primes
- Euclid's theorem: infinitely many primes, p1*p2*..*pn + 1
- sum of reciprocals of primes is divergent
- Mersenne prime: 2^p - 1, easier to test primality
- Sieve of Eratosthenes: find primes by removing prime multiples
- Prime gap: difference between two successive prime numbers
- Bertrand's postulate: ∀ integer n ∃ prime number p where n < p < 2n
- probability of two integers being coprime is 6/π^2
- Ulam spiral: integers in square spiral, lines with many primes
Composite number: natural number that is product of two smaller natural numbers
Fundamental theorem of arithmetic: every integer is unique product of prime factors

Twin prime: pair of pprime farimes with gap of two
- Twin prime conjecture: unproven, infinitely many twin primes
- Brun's theorem: sum of reciprocals of twin primes is convergent
- Polignac's conjecture: infinitely many consecutive primes with any even-length gap
Cousin prime: pair of primes with gap of four
Sexy prime: pair of primes with gap of six
Prime constellation: k-tuple of consecutive primes with smallest possible sum of gaps

Practical number: all smaller integers are sum of its distinct divisors (10 is not)
Aliquot sum: sum of all proper divisors
- Perfect number: equal to sum of its proper divisors (e.g. 6 or 28)
- Deficient number: greater than sum of its proper divisors
- Abundant number: less than sum of its proper divisors

=Lucas sequence: recursive, x_n = P * x_n-1 - Q * x_n-2
Fibonacci numbers: 0/1/P+Q, ratio of consecutive terms approach golden ratio
Lucas numbers: 2/1/P+Q, ratio of consecutive terms approach golden ratio
Pell numbers: 0/1/2P+Q, Pell / Pell-Lucas fractions approach square root of two
Pell–Lucas numbers: 2/2/2P+Q
Jacobsthal number: 0/1/P+2Q
Mersenne numbers: 0/1/3P-2Q, 2^n-1

Pi/π: ratio of circle circumference to diameter, irrational
- value: 3.14159265358979323846264338327950
- Feynman point: six consecutive nines at 762 decimal place

Geometric series: cake splitting
- ∑ 1/x^n = 1/(x-1)

=Riemann zeta function: ζ(s) = ∑ 1/(n^s)
Riemann hypothesis: Riemann zeta function has zeroes only at negative integers and complex numbers with real part 1/2
Harmonic series: ∑ 1/n, divergent
Basel problem: ∑ 1/(n^2) = π^2/6
- proof: apparent brightness of stars, inverse pythagorean theorem, line as infinite circle

=Faulhaber's formula: sum of first n p-th powers, ∑ n^p = (1/p-1) * ∑(p+1 r)n^(p+1-r)Br
Bernoulli numbers: additional coefficients in binomial expansion
Triangular numbers: ∑ n = n*(n+1) / 2
Pyramidal numbers: ∑ n^2 = n*(n+1)(2n+1) / 6

=Factorial: n!, product of first n integers
Permutation: arrangement of elements in sequence, order matters, n!
Combination: selection of k elements, order does not matter, (n k) = n! / [(n-k)! * k!]

Pascal's triangle: binomial coeficients, each entry is sum of left and right parent
- diagonals: 1s on edges, then natural numbers, then triangular numbers, then tetrahedral numbers etc
- rows: sum of row is 2x sum of previous row
Binomial theorem: (x+y)^n expressed as polynomial with n-th row of Pascal's triandle as coefficients
- (x+y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
- (x+y)^3 = x^3 + 3x^2y + 3xy^2 + y^3
