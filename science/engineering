Tensegrity
- compressed and tensioned parts (bars and cables)
- compressed parts do not touch
- tensioned parts are pre-stressed
- no bending moment, no shear stress

#Mechanical stress: deformation force
Normal: perpendicular to surface
Shear: parallel to surface
Tension: pulling
Compression: pushing
Torsion: twisting
Bending: curving

#Strain: deformation relative to size

Elasticity: return to initial shape when force removed
- Hooke's law: force is proportional to extension/compression (stress is proportional to strain)
Plasticity: permanent deformation when force removed
Yield point: between elastic and plastic behaviour

Roving bridge: over canal, allows crossing to horse towing boat
- split in middle or spiral ramp
