Tensegrity
- compressed and tensioned parts (bars and cables)
- compressed parts do not touch
- tensioned parts are pre-stressed
- no bending moment, no shear stress

#Mechanical stress: deformation force
Normal: perpendicular to surface
Shear: parallel to surface
Tension: pulling
Compression: pushing
Torsion: twisting
Bending: curving

#Strain: deformation relative to size

Elasticity: return to initial shape when force removed
- Hooke's law: force is proportional to extension/compression (stress is proportional to strain)
Plasticity: permanent deformation when force removed
Yield point: between elastic and plastic behaviour

Roving bridge: over canal, allows crossing to horse towing boat
- split in middle or spiral ramp

Gimbal: pivotal support allowing rotation, provides stability

Chain drive: transmits mechanical power (bicycle wheel)
- Roller chain: rollers held together by chain links
- Sprocket: rotating toothed wheel, teeth engage chain
Gearwheel: rotating toothed wheel, engage together, change rotation speed and direction (car transmission)
Geneva drive: translates continuous rotation to intermittent, pin on driving wheel engages slots [4/6] in driven wheel (movie projector)

Multimeter: measures electrical properties
Photoelectric sensor: infrared transmitter + receiver, detects presence or measures distance (automation)
Hall effect sensor: detects magnetic field (rotating magnets) to measure speed (motor control)
#Temperature
Thermocouple: two conductors, voltage on join depends on temperature, self-powered
- Type K: chromel/alumel, most common
- Type J: iron/constantan, cheap but oxidizes
- Type T: copper/constantan, low temperatures (fridge)
- Type E: chromel/constantan, sensitive
- Type N: nicrosil/nisil, high temperatures
Thermistor: semiconductor resistor, made from metal oxides, resistance depends on temperature, cheap and sensitive (electronics)
Resistance temperature detector (RTD): fine wire around insulating core, resistance depends on temperature, accurate and stable
Infrared thermometer: measure radiation, non-contact, fast response
Liquid-in-glass: liquid volume depends on temperature, mercury or alcohol

#Freezer: food storage, -18Â°C, thermal insulation + heat pump from inside to outside
Heat pump
- warm vapor is pressurized in compressor
- flows through condenser and cools down to liquid
- warm liquid is depressurized in expansion valve
- becomes cold liquid + vapour, liquid absorbs heat
- flows through evaporator and warms up
Refrigerant: used in heat pump, repeated liquid/gas transition
- R-290: propane
- R-600a: isobutane
- R-717: NH3 (industrial use)
- R-744: CO2
- hydrofluorocarbons (HFC)
- historically chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), banned
Thermal expansion valve (TXV): controls amount of refrigerant released to evaporator
- pressure increase in sensing bulb opens valve (flexible diaphragm actuates valve)

#Floodgates
Delta Works: Netherlands, Maeslant barrier near Rotterdam + Oosterschelde barrier + Haringvliet dam
MOSE: Venice, floodgates sealing off lagoon during high tide
Thames Barrier: London

#mechanical clock
Mainspring: spiral torsion spring, power source (~40 hours)
Suspended weight: drops over time, power source (~8 days)
Wheel train: transmits force from source to escapement, gears turn at various speed (hands)
Escapement: transforms rotating motion into impulses driving balance wheel or pendulum, locks and releases wheel train (constant speed)
Balance wheel/Pendulum: swings back and forth (time)
Balance spring: attached to balance wheel, causes oscillation with resonant frequency (accuracy)
