- mass of Sun, volume of Earth
- Chandrasekhar limit: maximum mass
Neutron star
- collapsed core of medium mass star

Black hole
- e.g. Cygnus X-1
- collapsed core of large mass star
- Event horizon: boundary where light can not escape
- Hawking radiation: radiation outside of event horizon, reduces mass of black hole
Accretion disc: diffuse material orbiting star
--
Naked singularity: theoretical singularity without event horizon, observable from outside
Cosmic censorship hypothesis: naked singularities can not exist

=motion
Orbit: regularly repeating elliptic trajectory of body around center of mass
- Inclination: tilt of orbit, retrograde orbit if angle greater than 90°
- Eccentricity: deviation from circle (0), below 1 elliptical, above 1 hyperbolic
- Orbital speed: faster when closer to center
- Periapsis/Pericenter: nearest point of orbit
- Apoapsis/Apocenter: furthest point of orbit
Rotation: circular movement around central axis
- Axial tilt / Obliquity: angle between rotational and orbital axis
Retrograde: motion in direction opposite of primary
Prograde: motion in direction of primary
Conservation of angular momentum:
- galaxy/star/planet material collapses under gravity, spins faster and flattens
- stars and planets mostly share rotation axis of galaxy

Galactic plane: plane with most of disc galaxy mass

=Star formation
Molecular cloud: gas and dust, forms stars if cold and dense
- inward gravity pull against outward thermal pressure
Protostar: young star, infrared radiation from thermal energy due to gravitational compression

Barycenter: center of mass of two or more orbiting bodies
Satellite: smaller body orbiting larger body, star and planet, planet and moon
- Regular satellite: prograde orbit, low inclination and eccentricity, formed in orbit, usually tidally locked
- Irregular satellite: distant or inclined or retrograde or eccentric orbit, captured
Trojan: celestial body sharing orbit of larger body, ahead/behind by 60°
Tidal locking
- rotation around partner takes as long as around own axis
- rotation slowed down by gravitation
- only satellite if body mass is different, both bodies if comparable mass
Roche limit
- distance where satellite will disintegrate and form ring
- tidal forces exceed satellite self-gravitation

Eclipse season: every ~6 months for ~1 month, solar eclipse at new moon, lunar eclipse at full moon
- Saros cycle: ~18 years period between eclipses (repeated Sun-Moon-Earth position)
- Exeligmos: 3x Saros, period between eclipses on similar location
Synodic month: moon orbit period in respect to sun, 29.5 days
Sidereal month: moon orbit period in respect to stars, 27.3 days

Conjunction: astronomical objects appearing close to each other in sky
