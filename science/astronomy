Hertzsprung–Russell diagram: shows relationship between absolute magnitude and spectral class of stars
Absolute magniture: apparent magnitude at distance of 10 parsecs
Apparent magniture: brightness of star observed from Earth, reverse logarithmic

#Spectral class: temperature of shell
Class O: blue, hottest, rarest
Class B: blue (Rigel)
Class A: white (Sirius, Deneb, Vega)
Class F: white
Class G: yellow (Sun)
Class K: orange (Arcturus)
Class M: red, most common (Betelgeuse)
Class L: brown
Class T: brown

#Luminosity class
0: hypergiant
I: supergiant (Betelgeuse, Rigel, Deneb)
II: bright giant
III: giant (Arcturus)
IV: subgiant
V: dwarf (Sun, Sirius, Vega)
VI: subdwarf
VII: white dwarf

Cosmic microwave background: uniform thermal energy from all parts of sky

#Cosmic ray
high energy particles from star
moving close to speed of light
90% solitary protons, 9% alfa particles, 1% heavier nuclei + solitary electrons + antimatter
produce pions + muons + neutrinos in atmosphere
Spallation: production of unstable isotops in atmosphere
- N14 to C14
- N/O to Be / B / Li
- Ar to various lighter nuclei

#K40
radioactive, long life-time ~1Gy
largest source of natural radioactivity
K40 isotope decays to Ca40 (90%) or Ar40 (10%)
used in K–Ar dating by measuring K40/Ar40 ration in minerals
produces Ar40 in atmosphere

#Star
luminous spheroid of plasma
10^24 stars in universe, 10^10 stars in Milky way
lifetime
- gravitational collapse of gaseous nebula
- hot core with high pressure
- hydrostatic equilibrium: gravity balanced by pressure
- composed primarily of hydrogen and helium
- radiation by thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium in core
- collapse as supernova, can result in nebula
Habitable zone / Goldilocks zone: range of orbits where planet surface can support liquid water
Supernova
- luminous explosion of star, comparable to galaxy
- source of heavy elements
- Kepler's in 1604, Tycho's in 1572
Kilonova: merge of neutron stars
White dwarf
- Sirius B, Procyon B
- collapsed core of small mass star
- low luminosity by residual thermal energy
- electron degenerate matter (Pauli exclusion principle)
- mass of Sun, volume of Earth
- Chandrasekhar limit: maximum mass
Neutron star
- collapsed core of medium mass star
- neutron degenerate matter
- mass 1.5 of Sun, radius ~10km
- Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit: maximum mass
- Pulsar: regular quick rotation, emits radiation out of magnetic poles
- Magnetar: powerful magnetic field
Black hole
- e.g. Cygnus X-1
- collapsed core of large mass star
- Event horizon: boundary where light can not escape
- Hawking radiation: radiation outside of event horizon, reduces mass of black hole
Accretion disc: diffuse material orbiting star
--
Naked singularity: theoretical singularity without event horizon, observable from outside
Cosmic censorship hypothesis: naked singularities can not exist

#Planet: spherical body with mass smaller than star and orbiting star
Brown dwarf: fuse deuterium, mass 20x of Jupiter

Comet: small icy body releasing gases when passing close to star, highly elliptic orbit
Asteroid: minor planet without atmosphere
Meteor: falling star, light streak created by heated object passing through atmosphere
- Meteor shower: higher number of meteors from one point
Meteorite: solid debris from outer space object

Meteor showers
- Quadrantids: early January
- Lyrids: late April
- Eta Aquariids: early May (Halley comet)
- Delta Aquariids: late July
- Alpha Capricornids: late July
- Perseids : mid August
- Orionids: late October (Halley comet)
- Taurids: early November
- Leonids: mid November
- Geminids: mid December

#Galaxy
Milky way: galaxy including Solar system
Large and Small Magellanic Cloud: satellite galaxies of Milky way
Classes
- Starburst: high rate of star formation (Cigar, Sculptor)
- Elliptical
- Lenticular: Spindle
- Spiral: Pinwheel, Sunflower, Black Eye, Bode's
- Barred spiral: Milky way, Andromeda

#Quasar
very luminous active galactic nucleus
powered by supermassive black hole
luminosity 100x of galaxy

#Nebula: luminous interstellar medium, often star-forming
Supernova remnant: Crab
Dark nebula: dense, obscures visible light, Coalsack, Horsehead
Emission nebula: gas ionized by young star, Ring, Omega
Planetary nebula: ionized gas of red giant, Cat's Eye, Helix
Reflection nebula: reflects light of nearby star

Orbit: regularly repeating elliptic trajectory of body around center of mass
Barycenter: center of mass of two or more orbiting bodies
Satellite: smaller body orbiting larger body, star and planet, planet and moon
Trojan: celestial body sharing orbit of larger body, ahead/behind by 60°
Tidal locking
- rotation around partner takes as long as around own axis
- rotation slowed down by gravitation
- only satellite if body mass is different, both bodies if comparable mass
Roche limit
- distance where satellite will disintegrate and form ring
- tidal forces exceed satellite self-gravitation
