#Terms
Vertex: basic unit
Edge: connects two vertices
Walk: sequence of edges
- Path: walk with all vertices distinct
- Trail: walk with all edges distinct
Cycle: closed trail
- Simple cycle: closed path

#Graph: simple undirected
Acyclic: without cycles
Directed: edges with orientation
Multigraph: allows multiple edges between same verices
Loop: edge conntects vertex to itself

#Types
Cactus: every edge is in at most one cycle
Tree: exactly one path between any two vertices
Forest: at most one path between any two vertices (set of trees)
