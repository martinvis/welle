#Silicon nitride (Si3N4)
very hard, thermally stable, chemically inert
production: 3 Si + 2 N2 -> Si3N4 (1300C)

Skatole
{C6}|NH-CH-C(-CH3)
in jasmine and feces, fecal odor (flowery in low concentrations)
used in perfumes

Propionic-acid
CH3-CH2-COOH
liquid, pungent smell
inhibits growth of mold
produced by bacteria in Emmental cheese and sweat
production: Ethylene + CO + H2O => Propionic-acid
use: food preservative

#Carboxylic acids (R-COOH)
product of oxidation of aldehydes or alcohols
methanoic acid = formic acid (HCOOH): ant/bee sting, preservative in livestock feed
ethanoic acid = acetic acid (CH3-COOH): vinegar (5%), solvent, precursor to vinyl acetate
- production: CH3-OH + CO -> CH3-COOH
butanoic acid = butyric acid: unpleasant body odor

#Esters (R-C=OO-R)
product of carboxylic acid and alcohol, pleasant aroma
methyl formate (H-C=OO-CH3): precursor to formic acid, production: methanol + CO
propyl acetate: pear (flavors)
butyl acetate: apple (natural)
isopentyl acetate: banana (natural), in alarm pheromone of bees
benzyl acetate: jasmine (natural)
octyl acetate: citrus (natural)
methyl butyrate: pineapple (natural)
ethyl butyrate: pineapple (flavors)
butyl butyrate: pineapple (flavors)
methyl cinnamate: strawberry (natural)
ethyl cinnamate: cinnamon (natural)

#Latex: emulsion of polymer microparticles in water
use: clothing, balloons
