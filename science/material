Annealing: heat treatment to improve ductility, heating above recrystallization temperature and slow cooling
- prepares metal for further processing
- recovery: softening metal by removing dislocations
- recrystallization: new strain-free grains grow
- grain-growth: metal loses strength
Hardening: treatment to improve hardness
- Grain boundary strengthening: decreasing grain size
- Work hardening: plastic deformation
- Quenching: heat treatment by rapid cooling, reduces grain size
Tempering: heat treatment to improve toughness, usually after hardening
- reheat metal under critical temperature
- decrease hardness but increase toughness (less brittle)
