#Matter - has mass, occupies space
Pure substance - can not be separated by physical methods
- Element (Atoms) - can not be separated by chemical methods
- Compound (Molecules) - consists of multiple elements
Mixture - consists of multiple pure substances
- Homogenous/Solution - uniform composition
- Heterogenous - not uniform composition

#Matter states - depend on temperature and pressure
Solid - fixed shape and volume
Liquid - fixed volume
Gas - expand to fill space
Plasma - contains ions and electrons

#Phase transition - change in state of matter
Melting/Freezing - Solid/Liquid
Vaporisation/Condensation - Liquid/Gas
Ionization/Deionization - Gas/Plasma

#Separation methods - separate solutions into components
Distillation - uses difference in boiling temperature
Crystallization - uses difference in solubility of solids in liquid, followed by filtration

#Properties
Chemical - flammability
Physical extensive - mass, volume
Physical intensive - color, melting point, boiling point, electrical conductivity

#Chemical change - creates/breaks bonds between atoms
Combustion - reaction with oxygen, produces heat and light
Rusting - reaction with oxygen, slow
