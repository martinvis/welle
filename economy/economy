#Heterodox economics:
Austrian school: minimal government intervention, actions of individuals
Modern monetary theory (MMT):
- taxes create demand for currency, manage inflation and redistribute wealth
- inflation is constraint on government spending

#Orthodox economics: mainstream
Keynesian economics: government intervention through fiscal and monetary policy
- demand fluctuations cause busines cycles (low=recession, high=inflation)
- central bank manipulates money supply and interest rates

Opportunity cost: potential gain of best alternative choice

Fixed/overhead cost: independent of output, recurring (rent, salaries)
Variable cost: depends on output (cost of input)
- Marginal cost: cost of producing additional quantity
Break-even (B/E): total revenue equals total cost
