#electricity
20% of energy consumption
source: 30% renewables (15% hydro), 10% nuclear, 25% natural gas, 35% coal
losses: 50% generation, 5% delivery

#oil
50% on road transport

#wind turbine
onshore
- tower height: ~100m
- rotor radius: 40-60m
- installed power: 2-5MW
offshore
- rotor radius: 75-100m
- installed power: 6-12MW

#nuclear reactor
output: ~1 GW
thermal reactors: with neutron moderator
- PWR (pressurized-water): water coolant, most common
- BWR (boiling-water): water coolant
- AGR (gas-cooled): graphite moderator, CO2 coolant
fast reactors: without neutron moderator
- SFR (sodium-cooled fast): liquid sodium coolant, experimental
- GFR (gas-cooled fast): He coolant, in development
neutron moderator
- water (75%)
- heavy water
- graphite
Uranium based: all current
Thorium based: in development
- more abundant less weaponizable material
- more efficient, less waste

#solar panel
efficiency ~20%
power output ~0.5 kW
area ~2 m^2, 72 silicon cells
