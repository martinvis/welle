Rote learning: memorization by repetition
Spaced repetition: flashcards, difficult more frequent
Meaningful learning: pattern recognition
Associative learning: association between stimuli
Episodic learning: result of event (fear)
Active learning: doing things

Trial and error: repeated varied attempts (brute force)
Behaviorism: behaviour is either reflex or learnt through experience (conditioning)
Learning curve: relationship between proficiency and amount of experience (skill/time)

Extinction: gradual decrease of learnt behaviour in absence of reinforcement
Spontaneous recovery: behaviour reappearance after extinction due to reinforcement
Classical / Pavlovian conditioning: neutral stimulus paired with unconditioned becomes conditioned (dogs salivated when hearing bell expecting food)
Operant / Instrumental conditioning: behaviour modified by reinforcement/punishment (animals in puzzle boxes)
- Law of effect: actions with positive results are repeated more and with negative results less
- Punishment: unpleasant outcome
- Reinforcement: pleasant outcome
=Reinforcement learning (RL):
Temporal difference learning: bootstrapping from current estimate of value function
- Reward prediction error (RPE): difference between estimated and actual reward
- dopamine mimics error function (increased firing on cue associated with reward, decreased firing when expected reward missing)
- relief is expected punishment not happening
- disappointment is expected reward not happening
Habit loop: cue -> action -> reward, dopamine surge shifts from reward to cue
Curiosity: adds intrinsic reward for surprising outcome or unknown state, solution to exploration/exploitation dilemma
- surprise releases dopamine even without reward (e.g. clickbait)
- risk of getting stuck in noise (solution: be curious only about things you can influence)
- Noisy TV problem: attraction to unpredictable but useless data (gambling/doomscrolling)

=Pattern recognition (PR): task of assigning class to observation
- neural networks process visual/auditory stimuli and recognize patterns
Generalization: group similar things together
Discrimination: separate different things apart
Object recognition: object identification based on visual input
Recognition-by-components theory: recognition by separating objects into geons
- Geon: basic geometric shapes used by brain to represent complex objects

Reward system: responsible for incentive salience and positive-valenced reinforcement
Aversive system: responsible for aversive salience and negative-valenced reinforcement
Motivational salience: attention based on importance of stimuli
- Incentive salience: positive (wanting), approach behaviour
- Aversive Salience: negative (warning), avoid behaviour
- Phobia: aversive salience to neutral stimuli, started by classical conditioning

Inverse problem: working backwards from observed effect to hidden cause
- recognition of 3D object from 2D projection despite brightness/distance/rotation/translation differences
- recognition of words from sound waves despite noise/speed/accent/pitch differences
Hebbian theory: synaptic connections strengthen between neurons active at same time (learning and memory)
Autoassociative memory: data retrieved based on partial or noisy version of itself

Short-term memory: information held for short time (seconds)
Working memory: information held temporarily (reasoning/decision)
Long-term memory (LTM): knowledge held indefinitely
Implicit memory: LTM used unconsciously
- Procedural memory: performance of task without conscious awareness
Explicit memory: LTM used intentionally
- Episodic memory: everyday events
- Semantic memory: general knowledge
Memory consolidation: stabilization after initial acquisition

Cognitive map: internal representation of environment in mind, allows navigation (in vertebrates + octopuses)
Episodic simulation: learning by imagination (in birds + mammals)
Constructive perception: unconscious inference from incomplete data, find most likely interpretation based on experience (causes optical illusions)
- prioritization of speed and usefulness over accuracy
- Amodal completion: pattern completion from missing input (object behind another object)
- Bistable perception: unique interpretation of ambiguous pattern (spinning dancer)
- Pareidolia: meaningful interpretation of noisy pattern (face on mars)

Action potential: in axons, long distance, constant amplitude
Graded potential: in dendrites, short distance, variable amplitude, higher information rate
=Neural coding: translation of stimuli into action potentials by brain
Rate code: stimulus intensity increases with firing rate of spikes
Temporal coding: information carried by spike timing or firing rate fluctuations
Population coding: information represented by group of neurons
Predictive coding: neocortex, brain generates and updates mental model of environment (inference)
- brain is in recognition mode when awake and in generative mode when asleep (dream, imagination)

Optical illusion: visual perception differing from reality
- Necker cube: 2D wireframe, ambiguous orientation
- Spinning dancer: rotating silhouette, ambiguous direction
