#eons
=Precambrian
Banded iron formation (BIF): alternating iron-oxides and iron-poor layers, caused by ocean (Fe rich and H2S poor) oxidation
Hadean (4.5-4 By): heavy atmosphere (H2O, CO2)
- Theia Impact: formation of Earth and Moon
- Faint Young Sun: 70% output

Late Heavy Bombardment (LHB): asteroids and comets
Archean (4-2.5 GProterozoicy): water world, archaea + bacteria, N2 atmosphere, greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4), Fe rich oceans
- Primordial soup: NH3 + CH4 + H2 + H2O + energy => amino acids + nucleotides + sugars + lipids
- Abiogenesis: monomers, mineral-assisted polymerization, lipid membrane, RNA self-replication
- Protocell / Protobiont: cell precursor, self-replicating lipid membrane with internal metabolism
- Warm little pond: origin of life on land near hotsprings
- Hydrothermal vent: origin of life in ocean near vents
Proterozoic (2.5-0.5 Gy): eukaryotes (archaea + bacteria as mitochondria/chloroplast)
=Phanerozoic (0.5-0 Gy): life on land, mass extinctions

=Proterozoic periods
Boring Billion (1800-800 My): tectonic and climatic stability, slow evolution
- Canfield ocean / Euxinia: anoxic (no O2) sulfidic (H2S) deep ocean
Paleo
- Siderian (2500-2300 My): Great Oxygenation Event
- Rhyacian (2300-2050 My): Huronian glaciation

- Ectasian (1400-1200 My):
- Stenian (1200-1000 My): Rodinia supercontinent, Mirovia superocean
Neo
- Tonian (1000-720 My): red and green algae
-- Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (NOE): oxygen rise in atmosphere and oceans
- Cryogenian (720-635 My): Snowball Earth (Sturtian + Marinoan glaciations), volcanic CO2 accumulation caused greenhouse effect
- Ediacaran (635-540 My): jellyfish, sponges
-- Gaskiers glaciation (580 My): short

=Phanerozoic eras and periods
Palaeozoic: trilobites

- Devonian (420-360 My): bony fish, ferns
- Carboniferous (360-300 My): insects, spiders, amphibians, Pangea supercontinent, Panthalassa superocean
- Permian (300-250 My): reptiles, cynodonts, sharks, beetles, conifers, Dimetrodon
- P-Tr extinction event / Great Dying: greatest mass extinction (60% families), fungi abundance, cynodonts+archosaurs survived
- Siberian Traps volcanic eruptions: near P-Tr extinction event, euxinia, increased temperature, acidified oceans
- Araguainha crater: Mato Grosso / Goiás (Brazil), near P-T boundary
Mesozoic: ammonites, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, cycads
- Triassic (250-200 My): dominant ichthyosaurs + dicynodonts + crocodiles, first flies, Pangea => Laurasia + Gondwana
--- Tethys ocean: between Laurasia and Gondwana, later Mediterranean Sea and Indian ocean
- Jurassic (200-145 My): plesiosaurs, crabs, turtles, wasps, mammals, Archaeopteryx, Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus
- Cretaceous (145-66 My): mosasaurs, flowers, palms, marsupials, birds, bees, ants, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Ankylosaurus
--- Iridium anomaly: unusual abundance of iridium in rocks at K-Pg boundary, meteorite impact (Chicxulub crater, Yucatán)
--- Alvarez hypothesis: K-Pg extinction event caused by meteorite impact
--- Deccan Traps volcanic eruptions near K-Pg extinction event
Cenozoic: butterflies, snakes, ungulates, carnivores, rodents, primates

=Cenozoic periods and epochs
Paleogene
- Paleocene (66-56 My): penguins, owls
- Eocene (56-34 My): whales, camels, horses, dogs, cats, pigs
- Oligocene (34-23 My): grasses
Neogene: mastodons
- Miocene (23-5 My): giraffes, deer, apes, hyenas
- Pliocene (5-2.5 My)
Quaternary: ice ages, humans
- Pleistocene (2.5-0.01 My): Smilodon, Woolly mammoth, Neanderthal
- Holocene

Geochronology: determine age of rocks and fossils by isotopes and paleomagnetism
Paleomagnetism: magnetic field direction recorded in iron minerals at formation time, latitude information

Carbonate–silicate cycle: 
- Silicate weathering: by carbonic acid (rainwater + CO2), 2 H2CO3 + CaSiO3 -> Ca + 2 HCO3 + SiO2 + H2O
- Carbonate precipitation: sedimentation, Ca + 2 HCO3 -> CaCO3 + CO2 + H20
- metamorphosis in mantle, CaCO3 + SiO2 -> CaSiO3 + CO2
- CO2 released to atmosphere by volcanism

Sulfur cycle:
- sulfides: by mineralization of organic sulfur
- sulfur: by mineralization of organic sulfur
- sulfates: by oxidation of sulfur and sulfides
- Assimilatory sulfate reduction: sulfate assimilated by organisms into cysteine
- Dissimilatory sulfate reduction: anaerobic respiration, SO4 -> H2S
- Sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB): energy source, H2S -> SO4

Volcanic winter: temperature decrease caused by sulfuric acid droplets blocking sun

#Paleoclimatology
S34/S32 ratio: S34 increase after Great Oxidation Event due to FeS2 oxidation, ozone layer ended mass-independent fractation
=Paleothermometer: estimate of temperature at formation time of material
O16/O18 ratio: more O18 in CaCO3 at lower temperature, less O18 in ice at low temperature
Mg/Ca ratio: more Mg replacing Ca in CaCO3 at high temperature

Strombolian eruption: mild blast, thicker lava
Vulcanian eruption: explosive blast, dense ash cloud
Plinian/Vesuvian eruption: ejection into stratosphere, can cause caldera

Dense-rock equivalent (DRE): volcanic eruption volume estimate
Volcanic explosivity index (VEI): volcanic eruption explosive size, logarithmic, 8 = supervolcano
