Self-replicating spacecraft (Von Neumann)
Dyson sphere: capture star energy output
Space elevator: cable from surface to space with crawler moving along
Alcubierre drive: faster-than-light travel by space contraction

Oblique wing: aircraft with single wing rotating in center, to reduce drag at high speeds
Tokamak: controlled nuclear fusion, strong magnetic field around plasma
