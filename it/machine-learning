Supervised learning
- labeled training data, input-output pairs
- produces inferred function
- performance measured on test data, that are separate from training data
Semi-supervised learning
- small amount of labeled and large amount of unlabeled training data
- assumes continuity, cluster or manifold distribution
Reinforcement learning
- modeled by Markov decision process
- gets performance score as guidance
Unsupervised learning
- learns without training data
- can analyze data or generate new data

#Support-vector machine
supervised learning

#Decision tree
- supervised learning
- at each step choose variable that best splits objects
- problems: overfitting, non-robust
Classification tree: target variable has discrete values
Regression tree: target variable has continuous values

#Neural network
supervised learning

#Clustering
- grouping similar objects into clusters
density based: finds high density areas, low density areas are noise
k-mean clustering: k cluster centers with minimal square distance of object to center
- median can be used instead of mean
fuzzy clustering: object can belong to multiple clusters
distribution based: finds object from same distribution - e.g. Gaussian
