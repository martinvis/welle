#Architecture
Dataflow:
Control flow:

Integrated circuit: microchip, interconnected electronic components
Capacitor: stores electrical energy, accumulates charges on two surfaces with insulator in between
Diode: conducts current in one direction, converts AD to DC
Transformer: transfers electrical energy between circuits, two coils wrapped around magnetic core
- use: electricity transmission at high voltage

#Resistor: reduces flow of electric current
Color code: 2 digits + multiplier + tolerance, gives ohm value
Digits
- Black: 0
- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
- Yellow: 4
- Green: 5
- Blue: 6
- Violet: 7
- Gray: 8
- White: 9
Multiplier: number of zeroes added to digits
Tolerance: maximum difference, default 20%
- Silver: 10%
- Gold: 5%

#AI accelerator / Neural processing unit (NPU): machine learning, manycore, dataflow architecture

MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor): fabricated by controlled silicon oxidation
- gate voltage determines conductivity
