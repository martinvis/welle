#Architecture
Dataflow:
Control flow:

Vacuum tube: controls electric current in vacuum between electrodes, replaced by transistors
Transistor: amplifies or switches electric signal
- gate voltage determines conductivity
MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor): fabricated by controlled silicon oxidation

Integrated circuit: microchip, interconnected electronic components
Capacitor: stores electrical energy, accumulates charges on two surfaces with insulator in between
Diode: conducts current in one direction, converts AD to DC
Transformer: transfers electrical energy between circuits, two coils wrapped around magnetic core
- use: electricity transmission at high voltage

#Memory - Volatile
Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM): stores data in memory cells, volatile, used for main memory
- Memory cell: stores one bit, capacitor + transistor, need periodic refreshing
- SDR: single data transfer per clock cycle
- DDR to DDR5: multiple data transfers per clock cycle
Static random-access memory (SRAM): stores data in flip-flops, volatile, used for cache

#Memory - Persistent
Floppy disk: magnetic storage
Hard disk drive (HDD): rotating platters with magnetic storage
- Platter: magnetic disk
Flash memory: no moving parts, NOR or NAND logic gates from MOSFET
- USB drive
- Memory card
- Solid-state drive (SSD)
Compact disc (CD): optical disc, laser beam, 700 MB
- Digital video disc (DVD): next generation CD, 4.7 GB
- Blu-ray: next generation DVD, 25 GB

#Resistor: reduces flow of electric current
Color code: 2 digits + multiplier + tolerance, gives ohm value
Digits

- Brown: 1
- Red: 2
- Orange: 3
