#Map projection
Equal-area: preserves areas, distorts shapes
Conformal: preserves angles, distorts sizes
Equirectangular: simple, distorts sizes and shapes
Mercator: conformal cylindrical, poles inflation
Behrmann: equal-area cylindrical
Peters: equal-area cylindrical
Eckert IV: equal-area pseudo-cylindrical
Winkel Tripel: pseudo-cylindrical, minimize area/direction/distance distortions
Robinson: pseudo-cylindrical, compromise between area and angle accuracy
Dymaxion: surface of icosahedron

Tissot's indicatrix: circles projected on map to indicate distortions
