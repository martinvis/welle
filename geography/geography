#Earth
Atmosphere: gases in multiple layers
Hydrosphere, water mass on surface
Lithosphere: elastic crust, divided into tectonic plates
Asthenosphere: ductile upper mantle, plate tectonic movement, 100-400km

#Atmosphere
Troposphere: lowest, most of mass, 10/15km, weather
Stratosphere: ozone, ultraviolet light absorption, 15-50km
Mesosphere: meteor incineration, 50-85km
Thermosphere: ionization, 85-700km
Exosphere: outer space

#Atmosphere composition
Nitrogen: 78%
Oxygen: 21%
Argon: 1%
Carbon dioxide: 0.04%
Neon, Helium, Methane
Water vapor

#Hydrosphere
water cycle: evaporation -> condensation -> precipitation -> infiltration -> runoff

#Theories
Continental drift: continents are moving over geological periods

#Tectonic plates
Eurasian
African
Arabian
Indian
Somali
North American
South American
Carribean
Nazca
Australian
Antarctic
Pacific
Philippine

#Plate tectonics
plate boundaries: earthquakes, volcanoes
Mid-Atlantic Ridge: Iceland
Circum-Pacific Belt / Ring of Fire: New Zealand - Japan - California - Andes
Alpine-Himalayan Belt: Alpes - Caucasus - Himalayas - Java
