#Earth
Atmosphere: gases in multiple layers

#Atmosphere
Earth rotates west to east
Earth is warmest at equatest, coldest at poles 
Earth rotation is fastest at equator, slowest at poles
warm air has lower density and rises
warm air cools at higher altitudes and sinks
Coriolis effect
- rotating object keeps angular velocity
- movement to poles causes relative movement with rotation
- movement from poles causes relative movement against rotation
Polar cell: pole to 60th parallel
- lower: from pole, westwards
- upper: to pole, eastwards
Hadley cell: equator to 30th parallel
- lower: to equator, westwards, trade winds
- upper: from equator, eastwards
Ferrel cell: 30to to 60th parallel, weak
- lower: equator to pole, eastwards, westerlies
- upper: pole to equator, westwards
Horse latitudes: around 30th parallel
- high pressure, calm winds, low precipitation, desets
Jet stream
- fast narrow eastwards air current between cells
- speed 150-200 km/h, at height 10-15 km

#Atmosphere composition
Nitrogen: 78%
Oxygen: 21%
Argon: 1%
Carbon dioxide: 0.04%
Neon, Helium, Methane
Water vapor

#Wind
Monsoon
- India, Indochina
- seasonal, rainy and dry phases
- wind from southwest brings heavy rainfall
- caused by difference in pressure
- land surface warms and cools quicker
- lower temperate means higher pressure
Tropical cyclone
- rotating storm, low pressure center, heavy rain
- hurricane in Atlantic, typhoon in Pacific
- forms over large body of warm water
- strong over water, weaken over land
Tornado
- fast rotating air column
- last minutes to hour
- central North America
- energy supplied by cloud (cumulonimbus)
Katabatic
- high density air flow from higher elevation down by gravity

#Cloud
High level: 3-8 km in polar, 6-18 km in tropics
- Cirrus
- Cirrocumulus: small patches, short lived
- Cirrostratus
Mid level
- Altocumulus: larger patches
- Altostratus
Low level: up to 2km
- Stratocumulus: large patches, light precipitation
- Stratus: foggy
- Cumulus: fluffy, light precipitation, precursor to cumulonimbus
Cumulonimbus: towering, precipitation (heavy), lightning
Nimbostratus: dark grey, continuous precipitation, no lightning

#Lightning
electrostatic discharge through atmosphere
caused by storm or volcanic eruption
produces heat, brilliant light and thunder (shock wave)
positive or negative
80% is cloud-to-cloud
electric current: 30 kA and 300 MV
worldwide: 3M strikes per day
distance: average ~5km, max 100+km
temperatute: 30kC
formation:
- cold air ice crystals and hot air water drops make charge
- bottom of cloud has negative and top has positive charge
- air insulates cloud and ground
- air is ionized (plasma) and conductive

#Hydrosphere
Water cycle: evaporation -> condensation -> precipitation -> infiltration -> runoff
- continuous movement of water
Transpiration: water movement through plant (evaporation)
Infiltration: surface water enters soil

#Theories
Continental drift: continents are moving over geological periods

#Tectonic plates
Eurasian
African
Arabian
Indian
Somali
North American
South American
Carribean
Nazca
Australian
Antarctic
Pacific
Philippine

#Plate tectonics
plate boundaries: earthquakes, volcanoes
- earthquake light
divergent boundary: between plates moving away from each other
- mid-ocean ridge: seafloor mountain system, seafloor spreading
- rift valley: within continents, often filled with lakes
- Mid-Atlantic Ridge: Iceland
- East African Rift: African/Somali plate, lakes Albert + Tanganyika + Malawi
convergent boundary: between plates colliding
- subduction: oceanic plate sliding under another plate
- orogeny: mountain building on continents
- Circum-Pacific Belt / Ring of Fire: New Zealand - Japan - California - Andes
- Alpine-Himalayan Belt: Alpes - Caucasus - Himalayas - Java

#Mountains
By erosion
- Butte: small steep-sided hill
- Hoodoo: thin tall spire
- Mesa: flat-topped, sedimentary rocks overlayed by harder rock
- Tepui: Mesa in South America
Tectonic
- Fault block, horst is raised, graben is depressed
Volcanic
- Guyot: underwater, flat-topped
- Tuya: flat-topped, steep-sided, volcano that erupted when covered by glacier
- Volcano
Plateau: high plain above surroundings
- volcanic, tectonic or by erosion

#Terrestrial biomes

#Climate change
Global warming: caused by fossil fuel burning, greenhouse gases, deforestation
- heatwaves, wildfires
